                "review": "### Feedback on Implications of Findings\n\nThe paper titled \"Acute Effects of Hallucinogens on Functional Connectivity: Psilocybin and Salvinorin-A\" presents significant findings on the impact of two distinct hallucinogens on functional connectivity in the brain, particularly in nonhuman primates. The implications of these findings are multifaceted and provide insights that extend beyond basic neuroscience.\n\n#### Key Implications:\n\n1. **Understanding Mechanisms of Action**:\n   The differentiated effects of Psilocybin (a serotonergic hallucinogen) and Salvinorin-A (a kappa-opioid receptor agonist) on functional connectivity suggest that the underlying mechanisms of these drugs are distinct and may engage different neural circuits. This differentiation aids in the understanding of how various hallucinogenic substances can induce altered states of consciousness and could lead to targeted therapeutic applications based on specific neurobiological pathways.\n\n2. **Clinical Applications in Mental Health**:\n   The insights into how these drugs modulate functional connectivity, especially in areas like the claustrum and DMN, may inform therapeutic strategies for psychiatric disorders characterized by altered consciousness or connectivity patterns, such as depression, PTSD, and addiction. The findings could lay groundwork for clinical trials testing these compounds in humans for such conditions.\n\n3. **Broader Research on Hallucinogens**:\n   By establishing a framework for how distinct classes of hallucinogens affect neural circuitry, the study opens avenues for further research into other hallucinogenic substances and their therapeutic potential. It could encourage researchers to explore more comprehensive studies that include a broader range of hallucinogens and their effects on functional connectivity.\n\n4. **Implications for Neuropsychopharmacology**:\n   The study contributes to the growing body of literature that illustrates the importance of understanding how hallucinogens interact with specific brain networks. This knowledge is crucial for developing pharmacological strategies that harness the therapeutic potential of these substances while minimizing adverse effects, guiding dosing regimens, and addressing safety concerns.\n\n5. **Potential for Novel Therapeutic Avenues**:\n   The findings highlight the relevance of exploring not only the therapeutic effects of hallucinogens but also their risks, particularly in how Salvinorin-A may lead to negative experiences or cognitive impairments. This dual perspective on the impact of these substances is critical in the ongoing discourse about their potential use in medicine.\n\n6. **Mechanistic Differences in Drug Classes**:\n   The clear pulling apart of serotonergic versus non-serotonergic pathways elucidates fundamental differences in the way these drugs operate. It suggests that future studies focused on functional connectivity can benefit from categorizing hallucinogens based on their receptor targets to better predict outcomes on neural activity and psychological experience.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n- **Methodological Robustness**: The study's within-subject design enhances its power but may still require validation in larger samples to ensure generalizability.\n- **Future Directions**: It would be beneficial to investigate longitudinal effects of these hallucinogens post-administration to understand if changes in connectivity persist and what this means for therapeutic behaviors over time.\n- **Ethical and Safety Considerations**: Discussions surrounding the ethical implications and potential risks involved in administering these substances in both clinical and research settings are paramount, particularly given the association of some hallucinogens with negative psychological outcomes.\n\nIn conclusion, the implications of the findings presented in this study underscore the potential of hallucinogens in both therapeutic contexts and basic neuroscience. The promise shown in elucidating the mechanisms of these compounds may lead to enhanced understanding and better treatment strategies for mental health conditions. Further investigations will be crucial in translating these findings into effective clinical applications."

                "review": "### Feedback on Statistical Analyses and Data Interpretation\n\nThe statistical analyses and data interpretation presented in the paper \"Acute Effects of Hallucinogens on Functional Connectivity: Psilocybin and Salvinorin\u2011A\" demonstrate a commendable effort to explore the neural mechanisms involved in the effects of hallucinogens on brain connectivity. However, there are several aspects that require improvement or clarification for a more robust and transparent interpretation of the findings.\n\n#### 1. **Statistical Methodology**\n\n- **Statistical Tests**: The primary method of analysis involves paired t-tests for pre- and post-drug conditions across different regions of interest (ROIs). While this is suitable for assessing within-subject effects, the rationale for choosing this method over more complex statistical models (e.g., mixed-effects models) should be discussed. Mixed models could accommodate variability between subjects and take into account drug dosage effects more comprehensively.\n\n- **Correction for Multiple Comparisons**: The authors mention correction for multiple comparisons, but the specific method used (e.g., Bonferroni, FDR) is not clearly stated. Given the multiple ROIs and statistical tests performed, it's critical to specify this to ensure that the findings reported as significant are not false positives.\n\n- **Effect Size Reporting**: It would be beneficial to include effect sizes (e.g., Cohen\u2019s d) alongside p-values for the statistical tests. Effect sizes provide context regarding the magnitude of the findings, which is particularly important in studies with small sample sizes, such as this one.\n\n#### 2. **Sample Size Considerations**\n\n- The use of three male rhesus macaques is a significant limitation. The sample size is small, which raises questions about the robustness and generalizability of the findings. The authors should discuss the implications of this limited sample size on the statistical power and the conclusions drawn.\n\n#### 3. **Data Interpretation**\n\n- **Causality vs. Correlation**: The paper often suggests that specific changes in functional connectivity are indicative of underlying mechanisms shared by hallucinogens. However, the interpretation should emphasize that correlation does not imply causation. Additional experimental or longitudinal studies would be required to infer causal relationships.\n\n- **Mechanistic Insights**: While the authors propose that both hallucinogens have distinct yet overlapping effects on functional connectivity, the interpretation of these results could be enriched by discussing potential biological mechanisms driving these connectivity changes more explicitly. For instance, elaborating on how specific neurotransmitter systems may mediate observed effects could strengthen the findings.\n\n- **Confounding Variables**: The paper briefly mentions confounding factors (e.g., differences in drug dosages, timing between administrations). A more comprehensive exploration of potential confounding effects, including physiological measures (e.g., heart rate, oxygen levels), would enhance the robustness of the interpretations.\n\n#### 4. **Figures and Statistical Representation**\n\n- **Clarity and Interpretation of Figures**: While figures are used effectively to illustrate connectivity changes, additional annotations to denote statistical significance (e.g., asterisks for p-values) could enhance clarity. Each figure should ideally include a legend that explains the significance levels and the underlying statistical tests associated with the displayed results.\n\n- **Data Transparency**: Providing access to the raw data or detailed supplementary information regarding statistical analyses will facilitate greater transparency and allow other researchers to replicate or further examine the findings.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis study contributes valuable insights into the effects of psilocybin and salvinorin-A on functional connectivity, but the statistical analyses and interpretation merit further refinement. Addressing the limitations outlined above will strengthen the conclusions and significantly enhance the overall validity and scientific contribution of the research."

                "review": "### Feedback on the Generalizability of Results\n\nThe paper entitled \"Acute Effects of Hallucinogens on Functional Connectivity: Psilocybin and Salvinorin\u2011A\" investigates the functional connectivity alterations induced by psilocybin and salvinorin-A in a nonhuman primate model. The authors propose significant overlapping and unique impacts on the brain's functional connectivity (FC) and suggest implications for understanding hallucinogenic mechanisms. However, there are important factors to consider regarding the generalizability of the results:\n\n1. **Sample Size and Species Limitation**:\n   - The study employs a small sample of three male rhesus macaques, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to broader populations, including both nonhuman primates and humans. Rhesus macaques do serve as a suitable model for some aspects of human pharmacology, but caution should be exercised in extending these results to human populations, given species-specific differences in brain structure, function, and behavior.\n\n2. **Dosage Variability**:\n   - The dosages for both psilocybin and salvinorin-A vary significantly within the study, and as noted, were not used as covariates in the analysis due to sample size constraints. The impacts of these variable doses on functional connectivity could lead to confounding results, and it remains unclear how these dosage specifics translate into clinical applications or effects in humans.\n\n3. **Specificity of Hallucinogenic Effects**:\n   - While the study highlights significant findings related to the claustrum, PFC, and DMN, it is crucial to recognize that the actions of hallucinogens may vary across different types or classes, as suggested by the authors. The specific functional connectivity patterns described may not be universally applicable to other hallucinogens or psychoactive substances, thus limiting the broader implications for all psychedelics.\n\n4. **Generalizability to Clinical Populations**:\n   - The established findings in a controlled, anesthetized setting may not accurately reflect human experiences with hallucinogens where environmental, psychological, and sensory contexts play significant roles. Acute effects observed in a clinical or recreational setting may differ from the context in which this animal study was conducted, raising questions about how such findings might translate into therapeutic settings.\n\n5. **Future Research Directions**:\n   - To enhance generalizability, future studies could include a more extensive sample size, explore a range of dosages systematically, and potentially investigate the longer-term impacts of these substances on functional connectivity in both NHP models and human participants. Integrating behavioral and psychological assessments alongside neuroimaging could provide a more comprehensive understanding of how these drugs impact various populations.\n\n6. **Limited Comparison with Existing Literature**:\n   - While the paper references previous studies, a more detailed discussion could strengthen claims regarding generalizability. Integrating perspectives from existing literature on functional connectivity changes in response to psychedelics would help frame the findings in a wider context and potentially validate whether similar patterns are observed across studies.\n\nIn summary, while this paper offers insightful data on the acute effects of psilocybin and salvinorin-A on functional connectivity in nonhuman primates, caution should be exercised in extrapolating these results to broader populations, especially to humans. Further studies considering larger samples, dosage standardization, and contextual variability are essential to establish the generalizability of these findings."

                "review": "### Feedback on Future Research Directions\n\nThe paper on the acute effects of hallucinogens (Psilocybin and Salvinorin-A) on functional connectivity (FC) presents intriguing results that lay a solid foundation for future academic inquiries into the mechanisms of these substances. However, several key areas could be expanded upon to more effectively guide subsequent research endeavors. Below are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Broader Class Comparison**: While the paper successfully highlights the effects of a serotonergic drug (Psilocybin) and a non-serotonergic drug (Salvinorin-A), future research should consider a wider array of hallucinogenic compounds. Including more drugs\u2014such as MDMA, ayahuasca, or 2C-B\u2014could reveal comparative insights into their structural and functional effects on brain connectivity and elucidate commonalities or divergences in their mechanisms of action.\n\n2. **Longitudinal Studies**: The acute phase is critical, but longitudinal studies exploring chronic effects could provide valuable insights into how repeated exposure to hallucinogens can modify brain connectivity over time. Such research should include assessments of both behavioral and cognitive outcomes to align functional connectivity changes with clinical benefits or risks.\n\n3. **Exploration of Individual Differences**: Incorporating a dimension of individualized responses\u2014such as genetic predisposition, psychological background, and previous substance use\u2014may enhance the understanding of how different individuals respond to hallucinogens. Future research could examine whether genetic or psychological markers can predict connectivity changes or subjective experiences during drug administration.\n\n4. **Neurobiological Mechanisms**: The discussion around thalamic connectivity is particularly promising. Future studies could utilize techniques such as optogenetics or pharmacological manipulation of specific receptor pathways to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying observed changes in functional connectivity.\n\n5. **Integration with Behavioral Assessments**: It would be advantageous for future research to integrate functional connectivity analyses with behavioral assessments during both drug administration and afterward. Understanding how changes in connectivity relate to specific cognitive or emotional experiences could bridge the gap between neuroscience and subjective experience.\n\n6. **Alternative Research Models**: The current paper utilizes nonhuman primates (NHPs), which provide insights due to their close genetic relationship to humans. Future directions may explore comparative studies using human subjects, providing a direct correlation to human cognitive and emotional experiences.\n\n7. **Impact of Contextual Factors**: Investigating how situational variables (e.g., setting, social context, expectations) can influence the effects of hallucinogens on functional connectivity would be highly valuable. This could help elucidate the complex interplay between subjective experience and neural network changes.\n\n8. **Functional Connectivity and Mental Health**: Exploring how alterations in functional connectivity might have persistent implications for mental health conditions\u2014such as PTSD, anxiety, or depression\u2014could be relevant, particularly in developing therapeutic protocols that might utilize these substances.\n\nIn conclusion, while the paper sets a robust groundwork, future studies should maximize the potential of understanding hallucinogenic compounds by extending their focus to broader drug classes, individual variability, long-term effects, and neural mechanisms. Integrating these new avenues into research will deepen our comprehension of hallucinogens' effects on the brain and their potential for therapeutics in mental health."

This approach is novel as it contrasts the effects of these compounds on functional connectivity in a homogenous biological framework (rhesus macaques), thus providing insights into both shared and distinct mechanisms of action.\n\n2. **Functional Connectivity Insights**: The study contributes new knowledge about the functional connectivity (FC) changes associated with hallucinogens that have different pharmacological profiles. The identification of common pathways, such as the involvement of the claustrum and angular gyrus, offers a fresh perspective on how hallucinogens may exert similar cognitive impacts despite differing receptor interactions.\n\n3. **Framework for Future Research**: By elucidating both overlapping and unique FC patterns, the findings set a foundation for future research to explore hallucinogenic mechanisms more broadly across different classes of psychoactive substances. This could lead to significant advancements in understanding how hallucinogens may be utilized in therapeutic contexts.\n\n#### Weaknesses:\n1. **Limited Scope of Substances**: While the study's focus on psilocybin and salvinorin-A is important, examining more substances within further studies could enhance its relevance, considering the broader psychedelic landscape is vast. Future work could expand the investigation to include other hallucinogens or variations in dosages to further clarify their effects on FC.\n\n2. **Explication of Mechanisms**: The mechanistic interpretations presented in the discussion, while interesting, may require a deeper exploration. Further detailing of the biological underpinnings or neurochemical pathways connecting FC changes to psychoactive experiences could enhance the explanatory power of the findings.\n\n3. **Generalizability**: While the research is conducted in nonhuman primates, caution should be exercised when extrapolating findings to humans. The neuronal architecture and responses may not perfectly mirror those observed in human studies. Highlighting this limitation and suggesting future cross-species comparisons would improve the robustness of the conclusions.\n\n#### Overall Impression:\nThe paper represents a significant advancement in the understanding of the dynamic impacts of different classes of hallucinogens on brain connectivity. Its innovative approach and methodological rigor contribute to the burgeoning field of psychedelic research. Enhancements in the breadth of substances studied, deeper mechanistic elaboration, and careful attention to species differences will further bolster its contribution to the literature."

                "review": "### Feedback on Ethical Concerns\n\n**1. Animal Welfare:**\nThe study employs nonhuman primates (NHPs), specifically rhesus macaques, for assessing the acute effects of psilocybin and salvinorin-A on brain activity. Given the known ethical implications surrounding the use of NHPs in research, it is crucial that the authors provide a comprehensive account of how animal welfare was prioritized throughout the study. Key considerations include:\n\n- **IACUC Approval:** Confirmation of prior Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approval is stated, but the authors should elaborate on the guidelines followed to ensure humane treatment of the animals. Moreover, discussions regarding the specific welfare protocols adhered to during the experiment would enhance transparency.\n\n- **Minimizing Suffering:** The paper should detail how any potential suffering was minimized. For instance, explaining the means of sedating the subjects, monitoring vital signs, and the administration of appropriate analgesics or sedation protocols is vital for demonstrating ethical consideration.\n\n**2. Justification for NHP Use:**\nWhile NHPs offer valuable translational insights due to their close genetic and physiological similarities to humans, the authors must justify the exclusive choice of this model organisms over alternative methods (such as rodent models). Clarifying why NHPs were necessary for this specific investigation versus other models is essential to satisfy ethical scrutiny.\n\n**3. Risk-Benefit Analysis:**\nThough the authors mention the monitoring of physiological parameters (heart rate, blood pressure, etc.), an explicit risk-benefit analysis must be provided. Detailing any foreseeable risks to the animals and weighing them against the potential benefits of the research findings will provide a more robust ethical framework.\n\n**4. Long-term Welfare Post-Experiment:**\nThe paper briefly mentions that all NHPs recovered successfully after drug administration. However, a more substantial discussion regarding their long-term welfare following the study is warranted. Sharing any follow-up measures to ensure ongoing health and well-being of the animals after the experimental procedures would enhance ethical clarity.\n\n**5. Potential for Misuse of Findings:**\nGiven the implications of research into hallucinogens, the authors should consider discussing the potential for misuse of their findings, especially concerning the therapeutic applications of drugs like psilocybin and salvinorin-A. Acknowledging this risk can lend a responsible lens through which the research is viewed and can imply culturally sensitive communication regarding their findings.\n\n**6. Consent and Transparency:**\nSince the research involves substances that can drastically alter consciousness, transparency in the communication and education regarding these substances' effects on such subjects would be beneficial. While direct consent from nonhuman subjects isn't applicable, a consideration of consent protocols for any human parallel studies using the findings may also be beneficial in the discussion.\n\n**7. Environmental and Societal Implications:**\nWith a growing interest in psychedelic research, implications relating to environmental sustainability and societal impacts of increasing psychedelic use should be discussed. This can prepare stakeholders and the scientific community for responsible dissemination and discussion about these potent substances.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe ethical concerns surrounding the use of NHPs in pharmacological studies are complex and require thorough consideration. The authors are encouraged to provide comprehensive details addressing animal welfare, justification for using NHPs, risk-benefit analysis, and long-term care and welfare measures for the subjects post-experiment. Additionally, discussions around potential misuse and societal impacts of their findings would further strengthen the ethical foundation of their research."

However, there are areas that could benefit from clarification or further justification.\n\n#### Specific Feedback\n\n1. **Animal Model**:\n   - The choice of rhesus macaques as the model organism is appropriate, given their close evolutionary relationship to humans and the translational potential of the findings. The age and weight of the subjects are reported, which is essential for understanding the applicability of the findings, but further information on the genetic backgrounds or handling of the subjects would strengthen the rationale for their selection.\n\n2. **Anesthesia and Imaging Protocol**:\n   - The methodology details a multi-step anesthesia regimen using xylazine and ketamine, followed by isoflurane maintenance. While this is standard practice, it would be beneficial to include a rationale for the chosen dosages and any pilot work that might inform these choices.\n   - The imaging conducted using a 3T Siemens MRI system with a BrainPET insert is commendable; however, more information about the quality control measures taken during fMRI acquisitions could enhance the robustness of the imaging data.\n\n3. **Drug Administration**:\n   - The differing dosages for Psilocybin and Salvinorin-A are next discussed. While the authors mention the rationale originates from separate studies, a brief explanation of how dose ranges were determined in terms of pharmacological effects would be beneficial.\n   - The use of varied dosing protocols might introduce variability that complicates between-group comparisons. A justification for combining data from separate studies, especially when concerning drug effects, would clarify the potential impact of this pseudo-random application on the results.\n\n4. **Functional Connectivity Analysis**:\n   - The preprocessing steps and functional connectivity pipeline are well described, including the use of seed-based analysis. The mention of nuisance variables and the methods for their adjustment (e.g., CSF and white matter signals) adds rigor to the statistical handling of data.\n   - A potential addition could be a more detailed discussion about the chosen frequency bandwidth for filtering (0.005 to 0.1 Hz) and how it aligns with accepted practices in rodent or primate studies, as this can significantly influence FC outcomes.\n\n5. **Statistical Analysis**:\n   - Use of paired t-tests with correction for multiple comparisons is a solid statistical approach; however, more explicit justification for the chosen significance threshold (p < 0.05) and cluster-forming criterion (Z > 2.3) would bolster this section.\n   - There should be a clearer explanation of how handling multiple comparisons was approached, particularly since functional neuroimaging has an inherent risk of Type I error due to the high dimensionality of the data.\n\n6. **Limitations**:\n   - The authors acknowledge ventilation concerns specifically affecting the Salvinorin-A group. Further elaboration on how ventilation impacts functional signal could guide future studies and address concerns regarding comparability between the two drug administrations.\n   - The mention of timing between drug challenges as a limitation is insightful. However, offering a clearer narrative around how varying intervals might have influenced connectivity outcomes would enhance this section.\n\n#### Suggestions for Improvement\n- **Clarity on Dose Selection**: Provide a rationale for dosages used, including any literature precedents or pharmacokinetic data that informed these choices.\n- **Expand on Data Handling**: Discuss how outlier behaviors or significant changes in physiological parameters were monitored and dealt with during fMRI scans.\n- **Address Limitations Thoroughly**: Enhance the discussion of limitations with specific examples of how variability in drug dosing and physiological changes might impact the findings.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThis study presents a well-executed methodology that effectively investigates the effects of hallucinogens on functional connectivity. Addressing the outlined suggestions could further strengthen the rigor and clarity of the methodology, ultimately providing more robust insights into the neurophysiological impacts of these substances."

The authors effectively connect their findings to prior literature, and the discussion is both thorough and insightful. Below are specific points regarding the interpretation of the results:\n\n1. **Clarity and Organization**:\n   - The results are generally well-organized, with clear headings that separate distinct findings. This structure aids in guiding the reader through the complex dynamics of FC changes brought about by the substances studied.\n\n2. **Integration of Findings**:\n   - The interpretation of increased FC between the claustrum and specific cortical areas is well-articulated. However, it would strengthen the argument to clarify how these findings relate directly to cognitive functions and the subjective experiences associated with hallucinogens. For instance, elaborating on how these connectivity patterns correlate with phenomena like altered states of consciousness or \"out-of-body\" experiences would provide deeper insights.\n\n3. **Comparative Analysis**:\n   - The comparative analysis between Psilocybin and Salvinorin-A highlights unique effects, such as the differential modulation of the thalamic connections. This point is important; however, the authors could enhance the interpretation by exploring the implications of these distinct pathways in the context of their pharmacological properties. Explaining why serotonergic and non-serotonergic mechanisms might yield these variations in connectivity enriches the narrative.\n\n4. **Discussion of the Default Mode Network (DMN)**:\n   - The section discussing the DMN and its dissociation following drug administration is particularly illuminating. However, it would benefit from a more explicit connection to existing models of DMN functionality in both healthy and psychiatric populations. Also, the authors might explore how the results might inform understandings of therapeutic mechanisms at play in conditions such as depression where DMN activity is often altered.\n\n5. **Limitations Acknowledgment**:\n   - The acknowledgment of limitations is crucial, particularly regarding the varying dosages and potential confounding factors such as ventilation control during the sessions. The authors might consider including a discussion on how these limitations might affect the generalizability of their findings, particularly when applied to human contexts where such controls would not be applicable.\n\n6. **Future Directions**:\n   - Suggestions for future research are both relevant and timely. The authors note areas for further exploration effectively. Expanding this section to include specific methodologies that could elucidate the causal relationships between altered connectivity and behavioral outcomes could offer clear pathways for future studies.\n\n7. **Figures and Visuals**:\n   - The use of figures to represent connectivity changes is commendable, as they visually bolster the interpretation of complex data. However, a brief discussion of what each figure contributes to the findings could enhance reader comprehension. For instance, clarifying which key conclusions can be drawn from each visual representation would contextualize the figures more effectively within the results.\n\nIn conclusion, the results interpretation in this manuscript is comprehensive and provides valuable insights into the neurobiological underpinnings of hallucinogenic effects. With slight enhancements in the depth of contextual analysis and clarity in connecting findings to broader implications, the section could significantly enrich its contribution to the field."

This is crucial for interpreting the robustness of the reported findings due to the multiple tests performed across brain regions.\n\n3. **Sample Size**: The analysis reports data from seven subjects per drug group. While this sample size may be sufficient for preliminary findings, more detailed power analyses should be performed and reported to justify this sample size and confirm the adequacy of the study to detect expected effects.\n\n### Data Presentation\n4. **Visualization of Results**: Figures provide a visual representation of the FC changes. Labeling and annotations could be enhanced to guide readers through the findings. Moreover, presenting raw data in supplementary material may help readers appreciate the variability and assumptions underlying the analyses.\n\n5. **Statistical Significance and Effect Sizes**: While significant results are reported, including effect sizes (e.g., Cohen\u2019s d) would aid in interpreting the practical significance of the findings. This is particularly important given the complex nature of functional connectivity and its implications.\n\n### Validation\n6. **Replication and Validation**: The study's design compares the effects of two drugs within NHPs, leading to valid within-subject comparisons. However, robust analyses should be cross-validated against existing literature or, ideally, replicated in additional cohorts to strengthen the claims about the effects on FC relative to known patterns from existing studies.\n\n7. **Discussion of Potential Biases**: Mentioning design limitations (e.g., effects of various doses, differences in timing between drug challenges, and potential physiological confounding factors) is commendable. Expanding upon how these could influence the statistical outcomes or suggesting methods to address them (e.g., statistical controls) may deepen the analysis's credibility.\n\n### Conclusion\nOverall, the statistical analysis provides a beneficial framework for understanding the effects of psilocybin and salvinorin-A on functional connectivity. However, enhancing methodological transparency, detailing the analytical process, and discussing robustness and replicability could strengthen the overall integrity of the research findings."

                "review": "### Ethical Concerns Review\n\n1. **Use of Nonhuman Primates (NHPs)**:\n   - The study employs rhesus macaques for its experiments, which raises several ethical concerns regarding the welfare and treatment of these animals. Nonhuman primates are sentient beings capable of experiencing pain, distress, and suffering. The authors state that all procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and that the animals were monitored by veterinary staff. However, further clarification is required regarding the specific measures taken to minimize distress, particularly during drug administration and imaging procedures. The justification for using NHPs instead of less sentient models should also be rigorously explained, emphasizing potential benefits to knowledge that outweigh the costs to animal welfare.\n\n2. **Informed Consent**:\n   - While the paper discusses the use of animals, it is essential to highlight whether equivalent ethical considerations are taken for any human subjects involved in the broader context of this research area. In studies involving hallucinogens, ensuring informed consent, along with a comprehensive understanding of the risks and potential side effects associated with the substances used, is critical.\n\n3. **Long-term Welfare**:\n   - The long-term impacts on the animals following exposure to psilocybin and salvinorin-A remain unaddressed. The researchers should describe any post-experimental monitoring or rehabilitation efforts for the NHPs. Ethical guidelines necessitate an understanding of both immediate and sustained effects on animal welfare post-experimentation.\n\n4. **Potential Misuse of Research**:\n   - Research on hallucinogens can have unintended consequences if misused, especially given the increasing interest in their potential therapeutic applications. There should be a discussion on the potential for misuse of findings or substances, and whether the researchers have taken any steps to prevent potential harmful applications of their work.\n\n5. **Communication of Findings**:\n   - Given the sensitive nature of the subject matter (hallucinogens and their effects), it\u2019s vital that findings are communicated responsibly. Authors need to address how they plan to disseminate their results to ensure that they are not interpreted out of context, which could lead to misinformed public perceptions or increased recreational use of these substances.\n\n6. **Details on Anesthetic Use**:\n   - The study mentions the use of anesthetics during NHP procedures. Ethical justification for this approach must include detailed rationales for the choice of anesthetics and assurance that pain and distress were minimized during the imaging procedures. Transparency in reporting any adverse reactions or challenges encountered is essential for a complete ethical review.\n\n7. **Future Use of Data**:\n   - The paper should clarify how the data generated from this study will be utilized in future research. Potential implications for further studies on hallucinogens, especially concerning their effects on cognitive disorders and psychiatric applications, must be addressed from an ethical standpoint to ensure responsible scientific integration.\n\n---\n\nIn conclusion, while the study brings forward significant insights into the effects of hallucinogens on functional connectivity, the ethical considerations surrounding the use of nonhuman primates and the handling of sensitive materials merit deeper examination and articulation. Addressing these concerns will help to strengthen the ethical foundation of the research and contribute to a responsible and humane scientific dialogue."

However, there are several aspects that warrant closer attention and some potential improvements.\n\n#### 1. **Animal Selection and Sample Size**\n- The study includes only three male rhesus macaques, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. A larger sample size could enhance the robustness of the results and account for individual variability in responses to the drugs. Additionally, the paper should address whether potential hormonal cycles or other factors that might differ by sex were considered in using male subjects exclusively.\n\n#### 2. **Anesthesia and Monitoring**\n- While the use of xylazine and ketamine for initial anesthetization followed by isoflurane is standard, the paper could benefit from discussing the potential effects of anesthesia on neural activity and functional connectivity. Specifically, the authors note that ventilation was required during Salvinorin-A administration due to safety concerns; it may be pertinent to explore how this confound could impact comparisons between the drug conditions.\n\n#### 3. **Drug Administration and Dosing**\n- The dosing schemes for Psilocybin and Salvinorin-A are described but without sufficient justification for the chosen dosages, especially since varying doses were administered to different subjects. Clarification on how these dosages relate to therapeutic or pharmacologically active levels and whether they correspond to known practices in human studies would strengthen this section. Moreover, the authors could explore the implications of using different dosing regimes from separate studies in the context of potential confounding variables.\n\n#### 4. **Imaging Techniques**\n- The imaging preprocessing steps are adequately detailed, but the methodology could be improved by including the rationale behind specific choices such as the use of a Gaussian kernel for smoothing and the extent of band-pass filtering. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to discuss potential limitations or biases introduced by these preprocessing steps. \n\n#### 5. **Statistical Analysis**\n- The statistical analysis approach, primarily the paired t-tests, is suitable for pre- and post-drug comparisons. However, the authors could enhance transparency by specifying the assumption tests (e.g., normality) that were performed to validate the use of paired t-tests. Describing how multiple comparisons were corrected in greater detail would also be advantageous for evaluating the robustness of the findings.\n\n#### 6. **Resting Time Between Scans**\n- The varying resting periods between imaging sessions, particularly when some were less than 50 days apart, raises questions about whether the short intervals could affect results due to residual drug effects or neural plasticity changes. Further justification for this aspect, including why these timelines were considered acceptable, would enhance the credibility of the methodology.\n\n#### 7. **Confounding Variables**\n- While the authors mention potential confounding effects of timing between drug challenges and baseline functional connectivity, a more comprehensive approach to controlling or discussing these variables would add to the study's rigor. Suggestions for future work to control for such variations could be included.\n\n#### 8. **External Validity**\n- The authors mention the translational relevance of their findings to human populations. They could enhance their methodology discussion by citing specific literature or studies that support their claim regarding the generalizability of findings from NHP research to human neurophysiology.\n\n#### Conclusion\nOverall, while the methodology of the study is fundamentally sound and thoughtfully constructed, addressing the above points could significantly enhance the clarity, rigor, and applicability of the findings. Recommendations for improvements could not only strengthen this research but also set a precedent for future investigations in this evolving field."

                "review": "### Feedback on Statistical Analysis and Data Interpretation\n\nThe statistical analysis in this study appears to be thoughtfully designed to provide robust insights into the effects of psilocybin and salvinorin-A on functional connectivity (FC). Here are some detailed points of feedback:\n\n1. **Sample Size and Power:**\n   - The paper mentions using three male rhesus macaques and pooling data to achieve a sample size of *N* = 7 per group. While the within-subject design enhances the ability to control for inter-individual variability, the relatively small sample size may limit the generalizability and statistical power of the findings. Future studies should consider increasing the sample size or clearly addressing the limitations of this approach in interpreting the results.\n\n2. **Statistical Methods:**\n   - The choice of paired *t*-tests for assessing changes in FC pre- and post-drug administration is appropriate given the within-subjects design. However, the reported use of multiple comparison corrections should be explicitly outlined in detail. It would also be beneficial to clarify the method used (e.g., family-wise error rate, false discovery rate) to prevent false positives, especially since multiple regions were analyzed. \n\n3. **Effect Size Reporting:**\n   - While the study indicates statistical significance (e.g., *p* < 0.05) for various findings, it would enhance the rigor of the analysis to report effect sizes alongside significance values. This provides a clearer view of the practical significance of the results and allows for better comparisons with previous studies.\n\n4. **Data Preprocessing and Analysis Pipeline:**\n   - The detailed description of the fMRI preprocessing pipeline is commendable. However, it may be useful to include additional diagnostics outputs (e.g., measures of motion, signal-to-noise ratios) to support the reliability of the data. \n\n5. **Model Assumptions:**\n   - It's essential to discuss the assumptions underlying the statistical models employed (e.g., normality in the distribution of *Z*-scores for paired *t*-tests) and any steps taken to verify these assumptions. A brief mention of how violations of these assumptions could potentially impact the results would provide depth.\n\n6. **Interpretation of Results:**\n   - The Results and Discussion sections effectively interpret the statistical findings in context, linking increases or decreases in FC to theoretical frameworks and previous research. However, some conclusions drawn may benefit from additional caution. For instance, while suggesting overlapping mechanisms between the drugs, it should be explicitly stated that causal inferences cannot be robustly determined from the current design alone.\n\n7. **Limitations and Confounds:**\n   - The discussion of limitations effectively identifies potential confounding factors, such as the impact of variable dosages and the need for ventilation during salvinorin-A administration. It would be beneficial to elaborate on how these factors were quantitatively assessed to mitigate their effects or provide justification for their handling in the analysis.\n\n8. **Future Directions:**\n   - The paper hints at future avenues for exploration, particularly regarding the relationship between the claustrum, angular gyrus, and PFC. This is promising and suggests avenues for hypothesis-driven research based on the findings from the current study.\n\n### Conclusion\nOverall, the statistical analysis is appropriately aligned for the data type and research questions posed. However, addressing sample size limitations, enhancing the interpretation of statistical significance, and clearly justifying chosen methodologies will strengthen the paper. Additionally, including effect sizes and discussing the assumptions of the statistical tests used would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the findings."

                "area": "Limitations and Future Directions",
                "review": "### Limitations and Future Directions Feedback\n\n#### Limitations:\n1. **Dosage Variability**: The authors note that the variable dosages of Psilocybin and Salvinorin-A during experiments were not used as covariates in the analysis due to limited sample size. This raises concerns regarding the robustness of the conclusions drawn from the data, as differing dosages can significantly affect pharmacological interaction and functional connectivity outcomes.\n\n2. **Anesthesia Impact**: The use of isoflurane for anesthesia may influence functional brain activity and connectivity measurements. While the authors assert that comparable functional networks can be identified under both awake and anesthetized conditions, the possibility remains that anesthesia might obscure or alter the dynamics of drug effects, potentially limiting the generalizability of the findings to awake individuals.\n\n3. **Lack of Respiratory Regulation Comparison**: The mention of ventilation requirements specifically for the Salvinorin-A group introduces another layer of complexity. The inability to control for respiratory impact on the functional signals means this could confound direct comparisons of functional connectivity alterations between the two drugs.\n\n4. **Timing Between Challenges**: The authors highlight that the timing between drug challenges could inadvertently influence results. Variability in these intervals might introduce additional sources of variability that could confound the observed connectivity changes.\n\n5. **Limited Sample Size**: The study\u2019s reliance on a small number of rhesus macaques (three subjects) to derive conclusions about hallucinogenic effects limits the statistical power and applicability of the findings. Subsequent studies with larger sample sizes would help verify the robustness of these results.\n\n#### Future Directions:\n1. **Controlled Dosage Studies**: Future research should aim to systematically explore the effects of varied dosages of both Psilocybin and Salvinorin-A in conjunction with control conditions that account for variability in dosage impact. A dose-response relationship could elucidate more definitive conclusions about connectivity alterations.\n\n2. **Investigating Anesthesia Effects**: To address the potential confounding effects of anesthesia, follow-up studies could involve a within-subject design that compares functional connectivity in awake versus anesthetized states. This would provide deeper insights into how anesthesia might skew drug effects.\n\n3. **Comparative Breath Regulation**: It's vital to develop methods to control for ventilatory impacts in studies involving anesthetics like Salvinorin-A. Implementing advanced respiratory monitoring techniques would help isolate the effects of the drug from respiratory influences on functional connectivity.\n\n4. **Longitudinal Studies**: Investigating the longer-term effects of hallucinogenic agents on connectivity changes could enhance understanding of their therapeutic potential for psychiatric disorders. Longitudinal designs could capture both immediate and delayed connectivity alterations over time.\n\n5. **Expanding Participant Diversity**: Future studies should include a broader range of non-human primates, potentially incorporating species with differing physiological and anatomical brain structures. Additionally, expanding into human trials with comprehensive demographic diversity could provide insights into the translational aspects of the findings highlighted in this study.\n\n6. **Integrated Multimodal Approaches**: Further research could benefit from combining functional connectivity analyses with other imaging modalities (e.g., diffusion tensor imaging) and neurochemical assessments to construct a more holistic understanding of the underlying mechanisms altered by hallucinogenic substances.\n\nBy addressing these limitations and pursuing these future directions, the research community can enhance the robustness and clinical applicability of findings related to hallucinogen-induced functional connectivity changes and their implications for therapeutic applications."

                "review": "### Feedback on the Comparison with Existing Studies\n\nThe paper presents an insightful exploration of the functional connectivity (FC) alterations induced by psilocybin and salvinorin-A, two distinct hallucinogens, using a nonhuman primate model. The authors successfully contextualize their findings within the broader landscape of existing literature, particularly regarding known effects of hallucinogens on brain connectivity.\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. **Integration with Previous Research:** The discussion effectively references and builds upon pivotal studies that have examined the effects of various hallucinogens on functional connectivity. For example, the authors cite Carhart-Harris et al. (2013) to support their observations of altered DMN FC via psilocybin, emphasizing continuity in research while highlighting the unique contributions of their study.\n   \n2. **Clear Differentiation of Drug Classes:** The paper establishes a comparative framework that distinctly categorizes serotonergic (psilocybin) and non-serotonergic (salvinorin-A) hallucinogens. This differentiation is crucial, as it attempts to address their unique functional connectivity profiles, an area often underexplored in existing literature.\n\n3. **Novel Insights into Mechanisms:** By contrasting the effects of the two substances, the authors propose a new understanding of common mechanisms underlying hallucinogenic experiences, particularly regarding the cortico-claustro-cortico (CCC) network. This contributes significantly to a more nuanced understanding of how different classes of hallucinogens can impact consciousness and cognition.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n1. **More Comprehensive Literature Review:** While the authors do reference existing studies, a more exhaustive review of comparative studies on FC changes induced by other hallucinogens, particularly the limitations of existing research (e.g., sample sizes, methodologies), would strengthen the context. It's essential to outline how the current study addresses these gaps, as this would solidify the relevance and contribution of their findings.\n\n2. **Critical Analysis of Contradictory Findings:** The paper could enhance its robustness by addressing contradictory findings from previous studies more explicitly. For example, while it is mentioned that prior research (Doss et al.) reported similar outcomes on the FC profiles of salvinorin-A, discussing reasons for discrepancies\u2014such as differences in methodologies, populations studied, or variations in measurement techniques\u2014would provide richer insights into the complexities of hallucinogen effects.\n\n3. **Future Research Directions:** Although the authors suggest future studies focused on the claustrum and angular gyrus, they could elaborate on specific research questions or methodologies that might be particularly informative. For example, incorporating longitudinal studies or exploring dosage-response relationships could elucidate the dynamics of FC changes over time and dosage.\n\nIn summary, the comparison with existing studies effectively situates the findings within the current understanding of hallucinogen effects on brain connectivity. However, a deeper engagement with literature, critical evaluation of conflicting data, and clearer suggestions for future research could enhance the depth and impact of the paper."

Most previous studies have focused on a single hallucinogen, making this dual-drug approach a critical advancement in understanding pharmacological differences and similarities.\n\n2. **Focus on Functional Connectivity Mechanisms**: The paper provides insights into how these hallucinogens uniquely and overlap in their modulation of FC within specific neural circuits, particularly the cortico-claustro-cortico (CCC) network. This detailed assessment extends the current understanding of how hallucinogens impact cognitive processes and consciousness.\n\n3. **Implications for Understanding Hallucinogenic Mechanisms**: The findings elucidate the differential impacts of hallucinogens on brain networks implicated in various cognitive functions, suggesting potential pathways that could be targeted for therapeutic interventions in psychiatric disorders. This is a significant addition to the literature given the current interest in the therapeutic potential of psychedelics.\n\n4. **Contribution to Animal Models in Psychopharmacology**: By conducting the research in a nonhuman primate model, the study provides a more translational perspective of functional connectivity outcomes observed in human studies, addressing a gap in existing literature that often relies predominantly on rodent models.\n\n#### Areas for Enhancement:\n1. **Comprehensive Comparison**: While the study frames its findings within the context of existing literature, a more extensive synthesis with other hallucinogens or class comparisons (e.g., classical psychedelics versus dissociatives) could strengthen claims of novelty.\n\n2. **Mechanistic Insights**: Additional insights into the underlying mechanisms driving observed FC changes\u2014perhaps through molecular or biochemical correlates\u2014would enhance the understanding of how each substance operates at a granularity that could impact future therapeutic applications.\n\n3. **Broader Implications**: The authors could consider discussing potential translational implications of their findings more explicitly. For instance, how might these results influence clinical applications of hallucinogens in the treatment of specific mental health conditions?\n\n### Conclusion\nOverall, the study introduces important novel findings that advance the understanding of functional connectivity in relation to hallucinogenic drugs. It serves as a pivotal piece of research that could drive future investigations and therapeutic strategies. The identified novel insights, coupled with some areas for refinement, suggest this paper holds significant potential for impact in the field."

                "area": "Ethical Concerns",
                "review": "### Feedback on Ethical Concerns\n\n#### 1. Ethical Use of Animal Subjects:\nThe paper describes experiments conducted on rhesus macaques, highlighting adherence to ethical guidelines as stipulated by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). However, further clarity on the ethical justification for using nonhuman primates (NHPs) would strengthen the ethical foundation of the study. Exploring the reasons for selecting NHPs over alternative models, including the necessity of their unique neurological and behavioral characteristics, should be explicitly addressed.\n\n#### 2. Animal Welfare:\nThe manuscript notes that animal health parameters (heart rate, blood pressure, etc.) were monitored during the experiments. However, detailed information regarding post-experimental care and monitoring, including any potential long-term impacts of the hallucinogens on the macaques, is essential. It should also indicate how many animals were involved in the study and if any adverse effects were witnessed, along with their management.\n\n#### 3. Justification of Drug Dosage:\nThe varied dosages of Psilocybin and Salvinorin-A administered are acknowledged, with an explanation provided about their initial independent studies. Nonetheless, ethical implications surrounding the administration of psychoactive substances to animals warrant a comprehensive discussion on how dosages were determined. This should include consideration of potential distress or disorientation caused by the hallucinogens, as well as measures taken to mitigate these effects.\n\n#### 4. Potential for Harm:\nWhile the study asserts that all animals recovered successfully after the experiments, it is important to thoroughly assess the potential psychological and physiological risks associated with the drugs tested. Hallucinogens can profoundly alter consciousness and perception; hence, a rigorous ethical evaluation of the implications of these substances on the well-being of the macaques would enhance the integrity of the research.\n\n#### 5. Transparency and Replicability:\nThe paper should incorporate a section discussing the ethical implications of the reproducibility of the findings. This includes how such studies can be performed in an ethical manner in the future, considering alternatives to animal testing and how findings can be translated to human contexts without compromising ethical standards.\n\n#### 6. Broader Impacts:\nThe evolving societal views on psychedelics and their therapeutic use should be touched upon, focusing on potential misapplications or misunderstandings of the research results in broader contexts (e.g., self-medication or misuse). Discussing how the research aligns with responsible advocacy for humane treatment in both animal and human studies is crucial.\n\nIn conclusion, while the study of functional connectivity in the context of hallucinogens among nonhuman primates is significant, addressing these ethical concerns comprehensively will bolster the paper's rigor and social responsibility."
