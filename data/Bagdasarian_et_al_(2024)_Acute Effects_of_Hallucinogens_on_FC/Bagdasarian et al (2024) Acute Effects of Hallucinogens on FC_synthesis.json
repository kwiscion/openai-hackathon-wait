    "synthesized_strengths": "The study provides novel insights into the acute effects of psilocybin and salvinorin-A on brain functional connectivity, particularly emphasizing the role of the claustrum in mediating hallucinogenic effects. The robust methodology, utilizing within-subject fMRI comparisons in nonhuman primates, enhances the reliability of the findings and their translational relevance to clinical contexts. The comprehensive analysis identifies both overlapping and unique neural circuits related to the pharmacological profiles of the substances, contributing significantly to psychopharmacology and offering insights for future therapeutic applications.",
    "synthesized_weaknesses": "The main weaknesses stem from the limited sample size of three nonhuman primates, which may hinder the generalizability of the results. The variability in drug dosages and administration protocols introduces confounding variables that compromise data integrity. Additionally, the acute nature of the study limits understanding of long-term impacts, and there's a lack of explicit discussion regarding implications for mood disorders, particularly in the context of salvinorin-A's adverse psychological effects. The absence of longitudinal follow-up could diminish insights into enduring cognitive changes post-exposure.",
    "overall_assessment": "Overall, the manuscript presents a valuable contribution to the understanding of how hallucinogens affect brain connectivity and cognition. The innovative approach and robust analysis underpin the significance of the findings. However, concerns regarding sample size, variability in drug administration, and ethical implications necessitate careful consideration. The study adequately contextualizes its findings but would benefit from enhanced discussions on long-term effects and clearer implications for clinical relevance.",
    "editorial_recommendation": "Minor Revision",

    "ethical_concerns": "The research presents ethical considerations surrounding the use of nonhuman primates, with some reviewers expressing concerns about animal welfare and the necessity of humane treatment protocols. Additionally, there are questions about the responsible translation of findings to human populations, especially with salvinorin-A, given its potential for adverse effects.",
