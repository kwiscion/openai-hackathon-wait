                "review": "### Feedback on Statistical Analysis\n\nThe statistical analysis performed in the paper titled \"Acute Effects of Hallucinogens on Functional Connectivity: Psilocybin and Salvinorin-A\" provides a structured approach to understanding the neural impacts of these hallucinogens, particularly in the context of the unique and overlapping effects on functional connectivity (FC). Below are specific points of feedback regarding the statistical methodology:\n\n1. **Sample Size Considerations**:\n   - The study includes a relatively small sample size (N = 3 nonhuman primates), which raises concerns about the robustness and generalizability of the findings. While the authors mention pooling data from two separate studies, clearer explanation and justification for the sample size in relation to statistical power analysis would strengthen the analysis.\n\n2. **Paired t-Test Justification**:\n   - The authors employed a paired t-test to assess changes in FC before and after drug administration, which is appropriate for within-subject designs. However, a discussion on the assumptions of normality and the non-parametric alternatives (e.g., Wilcoxon signed-rank test) could provide additional rigor, especially given the small sample size.\n\n3. **Multiple Comparisons Correction**:\n   - It's commendable that multiple comparisons were addressed with a significance threshold set at *p* < 0.05 and a cluster-forming threshold at *Z* > 2.3. However, additional details regarding the specific correction method used (e.g., Bonferroni, FDR) and the rationale for its choice should be included for transparency. This is especially critical in neuroimaging studies where the risk of false positives can be high.\n\n4. **Effect Size Reporting**:\n   - The results could benefit from reporting effect sizes (e.g., Cohen's d) for the significant findings. This would provide context for the magnitude of the differences observed, allowing readers to assess the practical significance of the results alongside p-values.\n\n5. **Model and Assumptions Validation**:\n   - Further elaboration on the validation of the statistical model, including any checks for homoscedasticity and normality of residuals, would enhance the credibility of the findings. Given the complex nature of the data and its analysis, outlining these checks strengthens the reliability of the conclusions drawn.\n\n6. **Visually Supported Results**:\n   - Although Figures highlight changes in FC, integrating statistical overlay (e.g., confidence intervals, p-value maps) directly onto visualizations in the graphical abstracts would facilitate a more intuitive interpretation of the statistical results in relation to the observed data trends.\n\n7. **Interpretation of Results**:\n   - The authors do an excellent job interpreting the findings. However, they could enhance their discussion by linking the statistical results more explicitly to the underlying neurobiological implications and the existing literature on hallucinogen effects on functional connectivity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOverall, while the statistical analysis is fundamentally sound for the study's design, addressing the areas outlined above will ensure a more comprehensive and rigorous approach to data interpretation. This will not only enhance the integrity of the findings but also bolster confidence among readers in the conclusions drawn regarding the effects of psilocybin and salvinorin-A on functional connectivity."
