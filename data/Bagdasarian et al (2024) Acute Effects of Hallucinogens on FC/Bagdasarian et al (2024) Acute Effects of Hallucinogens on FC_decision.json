    "rationale": "The manuscript offers significant novelty by comparing serotonergic and non-serotonergic hallucinogens, contributing valuable insights to the field of psychedelic research. However, major methodological and ethical issues require attention. A small sample size limits generalizability and the manuscript lacks sufficient detail on statistical methods, impacting the study's robustness. Ethical considerations, particularly the incomplete explanation of animal welfare protocols, are concerning. These weaknesses must be addressed to ensure the study's scientific and ethical integrity.",
    "key_strengths": "1. Novelty in comparing serotonergic and non-serotonergic hallucinogens.\n2. Strong integration with existing literature.\n3. Potential significant impact on understanding therapeutic uses of psychedelics.",
    "key_weaknesses": "1. Small sample size limits generalizability.\n2. Insufficient methodological details, especially statistical methods.\n3. Unclear distinctions between different analyses.\n4. Incomplete ethical considerations regarding animal welfare.",
    "specific_revisions": "1. Increase sample size if possible or provide a detailed justification for the current size.\n2. Enhance the description of statistical methods and clarify distinctions between different analyses.\n3. Provide a thorough discussion on ethical considerations, particularly regarding animal welfare protocols.",
