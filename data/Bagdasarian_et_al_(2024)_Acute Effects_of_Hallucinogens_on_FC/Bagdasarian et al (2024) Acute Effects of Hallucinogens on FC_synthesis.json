    "synthesized_strengths": "1. **Novel Comparative Analysis**: The study introduces a unique comparison between serotonergic (psilocybin) and non-serotonergic (salvinorin-A) hallucinogens, enhancing understanding of their effects on functional connectivity.\n2. **Methodological Rigor**: Employing fMRI and detailed assessments of brain connectivity heightens the validity of the conclusions drawn.\n3. **Clinical Relevance**: The potential applications of these findings in treating psychiatric disorders, particularly anxiety and depression, are well-articulated, showcasing the relevance of the research.\n4. **Insights into Receptor Dynamics**: The emphasis on the roles of 5-HT2AR and KOR receptors contributes to a better understanding of the pharmacodynamics in therapeutic contexts, which could inform future research directions.",
    "synthesized_weaknesses": "1. **Limited Sample Size**: The study's reliance on only three nonhuman primates restricts its generalizability and raises concerns regarding statistical power.\n2. **Variability in Dosing**: Different dosages of psilocybin and salvinorin-A introduce complexity in comparisons and may affect results.\n3. **Lack of Behavioral Correlations**: The absence of corresponding behavioral data diminishes the ability to link neurobiological changes to subjective experiences or clinical relevance.\n4. **Confounding Factors**: Issues regarding anesthesia effects and timing of drug administration need to be better controlled for and acknowledged.",
    "overall_assessment": "The manuscript presents a commendable exploration of hallucinogenic effects on functional connectivity, specifically addressing both serotonergic and non-serotonergic pathways. It draws meaningful connections between neurobiological mechanisms and potential therapeutic implications, yet concerns regarding the small sample size, variability in dosing, and lack of behavioral assessments remain significant. Overall, the study is well-structured and relevant, offering key insights while warranting further validation in future research with larger sample sizes.",
    "editorial_recommendation": "Major Revision",
