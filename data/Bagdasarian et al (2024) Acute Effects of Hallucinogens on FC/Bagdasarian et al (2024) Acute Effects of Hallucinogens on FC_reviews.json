        "strengths": "The study effectively compares the functional connectivity changes induced by two distinct hallucinogens, psilocybin and salvinorin-A, within the same nonhuman primate subjects. This within-subject design minimizes variability and enhances the validity of the results. The use of fMRI to investigate functional connectivity provides a clear methodological approach to understanding differences in brain network function under the influence of these substances.",
        "weaknesses": "The sample size is relatively small (only three rhesus macaques), which may limit the statistical power and generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the varying dosages of the two drugs between subjects and the use of different anesthesia protocols may introduce confounds that could affect connectivity measures. The paper also does not adequately address potential long-term effects of the substances administered.",
        "comments": "The results pointing towards distinct functional connectivity patterns related to the claustrum and the differentiation between serotonergic and non-serotonergic hallucinogens are particularly interesting. However, the authors should clarify how the findings could be expanded to human studies and potential clinical implications more explicitly. Discussion on future avenues for research on dosage control and longer-term drug effects would enhance the paper.",

        "strengths": "The paper presents novel findings on the effects of psilocybin and salvinorin-A on functional connectivity using sophisticated fMRI methods, providing valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underlying hallucinogenic states. The study design, which uses a within-subject comparison of two distinct pharmacological classes, is particularly strong and addresses a significant gap in the literature. The findings support the theoretical framework of cortico-claustral connectivity and expand upon existing models of hallucinogenic action in the brain.",
        "weaknesses": "One of the main weaknesses is the small sample size (only three male rhesus macaques), which could limit the generalizability and robustness of the findings. The differing dosage protocols for psilocybin and salvinorin-A could introduce variability that complicates the interpretation of results. Additionally, potential confounding factors associated with anesthesia and ventilation may affect functional connectivity outcomes, raising concerns about the reliability of comparisons between the two drug conditions.",
        "comments": "The authors effectively tie their results to existing literature and theoretical models, enhancing the impact of their work. More detailed discussion on how the differences in connectivity could relate to subjective experiences or behavioral effects of the hallucinogens would strengthen the paper further. Additionally, addressing the potential for habituation effects or inherent biological variability in NHPs could provide a more nuanced understanding of the results.",

        "strengths": "1. The study utilizes advanced functional connectivity MRI to explore differences between Psilocybin and Salvinorin-A, offering novel insights into their effects on brain connectivity.\n2. The within-subject design allows for better controlled comparisons between the two different hallucinogens, addressing a gap in the literature.\n3. Clear hypothesis formulation and robust methodology, including careful monitoring of animal health throughout the experimentation.\n4. The results contribute to ongoing discussions about the mechanisms of action of hallucinogens and their potential therapeutic applications.",
        "weaknesses": "1. Limited number of subjects (only three NHPs) raises concerns about the generalizability of findings.\n2. The variability in drug dosage among the subjects may introduce confounding effects that could influence the results and their interpretation.\n3. The necessity of mechanical ventilation in the Salvinorin-A group complicates direct comparisons between the groups.\n4. The authors note limitations related to autonomic systems that could influence functional connectivity measurements, yet these are not fully addressed.",
        "comments": "The paper provides substantial contributions to the understanding of hallucinogen-induced changes in functional connectivity within the brain. However, the small sample size and variability in drug administration could affect the robustness of the conclusions drawn. Future studies should consider larger sample sizes and more consistent dosing protocols to validate and build on these findings.",
