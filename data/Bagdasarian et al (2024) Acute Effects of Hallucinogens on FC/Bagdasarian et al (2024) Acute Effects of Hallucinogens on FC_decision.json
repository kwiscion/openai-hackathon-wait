    "rationale": "The manuscript offers valuable insights into the effects of psilocybin and salvinorin-A on brain connectivity, particularly through its novel focus on the claustrum and consciousness. The study utilizes a robust within-subject design which is a significant strength. However, several key issues limit the manuscript's impact and require substantial revisions. The small sample size of N=3 raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the manuscript lacks discussion on effect sizes, statistical validation, and does not correlate connectivity changes with behavioral outcomes, all of which undermine the conclusions' strength. Ethical concerns regarding animal use must also be addressed, providing more detail on animal welfare practices.",
