    "decision": "major revisions",
    "rationale": "The manuscript presents innovative research on the effects of hallucinogens on functional connectivity within nonhuman primates, contributing meaningful findings particularly concerning the roles of psilocybin and salvinorin-A. However, the study has significant methodological limitations, including a small sample size and potential confounding variables related to drug dosages and anesthesia. These issues raise concerns about the robustness and generalizability of the conclusions drawn. The authors must address these methodological concerns and improve the clarity of their results and interpretations before proceeding to publication.",
    "key_strengths": "1. Innovative and relevant approach utilizing nonhuman primates for translational research on hallucinogens. 2. Robust methodology featuring seed-based functional connectivity MRI and a within-subject design enhances rigor. 3. Novel findings that highlight connectivity patterns associated with the claustrum and differential effects of psilocybin vs. salvinorin-A, advancing neuropharmacological understanding.",
    "key_weaknesses": "1. Limited sample size (only three NHPs) restricts generalizability of the results. 2. Methodological concerns introduced by variable drug dosages and anesthesia complicate reliability. 3. Complexity of results requires clearer visualizations and deeper discussions to convey connectivity changes and implications effectively.",
    "specific_revisions": "1. Expand the sample size to enhance the power and generalizability of the study. 2. Clarify the impact of drug dosage variations on the results and consider controlling for anesthesia effects where possible. 3. Improve visualizations of results and enhance the discussion around the interpretations of findings, particularly in relation to the connectivity changes observed.",
    "priority_issues": [
        "Address the small sample size by including additional subjects in future iterations of the study.",
        "Provide a detailed rationale for drug dosing protocols and their implications.",
        "Enhance clarity around the interpretation of the complex connectivity results. "
    ],
    "ethical_considerations": "The study raises important ethical considerations regarding the use of nonhuman primates (NHPs) in research. The authors should provide a more comprehensive discussion on animal welfare, justification for their use, and potential implications of administering hallucinogens in a research context."
