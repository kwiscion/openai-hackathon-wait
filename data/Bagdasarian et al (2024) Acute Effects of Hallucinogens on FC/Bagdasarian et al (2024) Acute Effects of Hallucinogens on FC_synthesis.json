Distinctions between different types of analyses are unclear, leading to interpretation challenges. Additionally, ethical considerations, specifically regarding animal welfare, are inadequately addressed and need more thorough exploration.",
    "overall_assessment": "The paper offers novel insights and makes a important contribution to the field of psychedelic research. However, significant methodological and ethical concerns must be addressed to enhance the study's reliability and ethical standing. Improving methodological transparency and providing a more comprehensive ethical discussion are essential.",
    "editorial_recommendation": "Major Revision",
    "confidence_assessment": "The review reflects some uncertainty due to methodological ambiguities and ethical concerns, suggesting that revisions are necessary before more confidence can be placed in the study's findings.",
    "ethical_concerns": "There are ethical concerns about the use of nonhuman primates, which include questions on animal welfare, justification of dosages, and potential negative effects from hallucinogen exposure. Improved clarity on monitoring and long-term impact protocols is necessary to meet ethical research standards.",
