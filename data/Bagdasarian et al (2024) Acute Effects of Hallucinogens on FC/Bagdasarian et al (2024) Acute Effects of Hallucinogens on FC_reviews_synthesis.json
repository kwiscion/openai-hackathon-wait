    "synthesized_strengths": "The manuscript is praised for its innovative approach and the novelty of comparing the effects of psilocybin and salvinorin-A on functional connectivity, addressing a significant gap in existing literature. The use of nonhuman primates (NHPs) is noted as a strength, offering more relevant insights compared to rodent models. Methodologically, the study is recognized for its rigorous fMRI techniques, the introduction of the cortico-claustro-cortico network framework, and its potential implications for psychiatric research. The authors effectively contextualize findings within psychiatric disorders, proposing therapeutic avenues.",
    "synthesized_weaknesses": "The primary weaknesses identified include the small sample size, which affects both statistical power and generalizability. The study's dosing regimens and the lack of controls for varying resting times between scans are noted as significant methodological concerns. The potential impact of anesthesia on functional connectivity is inadequately addressed, and there is a need for more clarity in control measures to avoid carryover effects. Additionally, there's a call for explicit discussion on the long-term effects of hallucinogen exposure on NHPs.",
    "overall_assessment": "The manuscript provides a strong foundation with notable methodological and conceptual contributions to the study of hallucinogens. However, the research's statistical limitations, particularly due to the small sample size, and methodological issues related to dosing and anesthesia must be addressed to strengthen the study's conclusions. Ethical considerations, particularly concerning animal welfare and long-term effects, require more comprehensive exploration.",
    "editorial_recommendation": "Minor Revision",
    "confidence_assessment": "All reviewers expressed confidence in their assessments, consistent with the identification of shared strengths and weaknesses.",
    "ethical_concerns": "Ethical concerns extend to the use of nonhuman primates and involve welfare considerations, including stress management and long-term impacts. Transparency on ethical approvals, compliance with regulations for controlled substances, and robust justification for using NHPs are necessary.",
