                "review": "### Feedback on Study Limitations and Future Directions\n\n**Study Limitations:**\n\n1. **Variable Dosages:** One of the primary limitations highlighted is the lack of covariate analysis for the variable dosages of Psilocybin and Salvinorin-A. This limitation is significant because dosage can greatly influence the pharmacodynamic effects and may confound the results. Future research should aim to standardize dosages or include dosage as a covariate in the statistical analyses to obtain clearer insights into the dose-response relationships.\n\n2. **Ventilation Effects:** The need for ventilation in the Salvinorin-A group introduces a confound that compromises the comparability of the functional connectivity data between the two substances. Since Salvinorin-A was administered with precautionary ventilation due to its potential respiratory effects, this difference in methodology adds complexity and undermines the validity of comparisons made between the two drugs. Future studies could include additional control groups or parameters that account for these variances.\n\n3. **Timing of Drug Challenges:** The observed lack of significant associations due to the timing between hallucinogenic drug challenges adds another layer of complexity. If resting times between drug challenges were not uniform or optimal, this could affect the baseline functional connectivity measurements. A more robust experimental design would involve consistent timing of drug administration relative to the imaging sessions, which could strengthen the findings.\n\n4. **Scale and Generalizability:** The limited sample size (three male rhesus macaques) raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings to a broader population. More extensive studies with diverse animal subjects could help validate the findings and improve external validity.\n\n5. **Anesthesia Effects:** The use of isoflurane anesthesia, while necessary for the imaging procedure, may have unknown influences on neural connectivity. Considering the potential impact of anesthesia on neurophysiology, future studies should explore functional connectivity changes in awake rather than anesthetized conditions, or at least conduct a thorough assessment of how anesthesia might confound results.\n\n**Future Directions:**\n\n1. **Broader Pharmacological Profile Examination:** Future research could benefit from comparing a wider range of hallucinogens and their associated pharmacological profiles to elucidate their effects on functional connectivity comprehensively. Including other hallucinogens such as MDMA or DMT, with different receptor interactions, may provide deeper insights into the mechanisms at play.\n\n2. **Longitudinal Studies:** To assess the long-term effects of hallucinogens on functional connectivity, longitudinal studies could be implemented. It could be beneficial to explore how changes in connectivity evolve over time post-administration, contributing valuable data on the duration and persistence of the drug effects.\n\n3. **Integration with Behavioral Outcomes:** Investigating the relationship between functional connectivity changes and subjective or behavioral outcomes (e.g., experiences reported by subjects during hallucinogen exposure) may enrich findings. This will allow researchers to correlate neural changes with experiential states, potentially leading to better understanding of the subjective effects of hallucinogens.\n\n4. **Examining Mechanistic Pathways:** Future studies should delve deeper into the underlying neurobiological mechanisms that link pharmacological action to functional connectivity changes. For instance, exploring downstream effects of receptor activation on neural circuit dynamics could help in building a coherent framework regarding how hallucinogens induce perceptual and cognitive changes.\n\n5. **Dosing Studies:** Future studies should consider employing a more systematic approach in examining the dose-response relationship for hallucinogens, potentially establishing optimal dosing levels for eliciting specific functional connectivity profiles.\n\nBy addressing these limitations and exploring these future directions, subsequent research could yield robust and insightful findings that enhance our understanding of hallucinogenic substances\u2019 impact on brain connectivity and behavior."

This comparative approach is novel, as it addresses a critical gap in the existing literature, which has primarily focused on individual effects of these substances rather than their comparative impacts on functional brain connectivity.\n\n1. **Comparative Framework**: The novelty lies in the direct comparison of the acute effects of a serotonergic agent (psilocybin) and a non-serotonergic agent (salvinorin-A) on brain connectivity patterns. Prior research has often limited itself to examining these substances independently, making this comparative analysis a valuable contribution to psychopharmacology.\n\n2. **Unique Insights into Functional Connectivity**: The study identifies overlapping and distinct patterns of functional connectivity that the two hallucinogens induce, particularly in relation to crucial brain regions like the claustrum, prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and angular gyrus. This allows for a more nuanced understanding of how different hallucinogens might influence brain function and consciousness through unique mechanisms, which is not extensively covered in previous studies.\n\n3. **Extension of Existing Models**: The authors extend and contribute to the existing concept of the cortico-claustro-cortical (CCC) model by integrating findings from both substances, highlighting their differing impacts on the same neural circuits. This adds a new dimension to the understanding of the diversity in hallucinogenic experiences and their neural correlates.\n\n4. **Potential Clinical Implications**: The findings have implications for the therapeutic use of these substances, particularly in understanding how individual hallucinogens might be selectively targeted for specific psychiatric conditions, thus enhancing the practical utility of this research.\n\n5. **Methodological Rigor**: Utilizing nonhuman primates allows the researchers to explore pharmacological effects in a model that has neurological similarities to human beings, strengthening the translational potential of the findings.\n\nIn summary, this paper introduces notable novelty by elucidating how different hallucinogens affect functional brain connectivity and consciousness. The comparative approach, along with the identification of common and diverging neural mechanisms, positions the research as a critical addition to the current understanding of hallucinogenic drugs and their potential therapeutic applications in psychiatric disorders. Further exploration and validation of these findings in human studies would be invaluable to fully realize their implications."

However, several areas could benefit from further clarification and detail, alongside some potential improvements that could enhance the rigor and reproducibility of the results.\n\n### Specific Feedback\n\n1. **Statistical Methods Description:**\n   - It would be beneficial to elaborate on the statistical methods used for analyzing functional connectivity (FC) data. While the paper mentions using paired t-tests and statistical correction for multiple comparisons, clearer details on the specific correction methods used (e.g., Bonferroni, FDR) should be included. Furthermore, specifying how the statistical threshold (e.g., *p* < 0.05) was determined could enhance transparency.\n\n2. **Sample Size Justification:**\n   - The manuscript states that *N* = 7 was achieved per group through pooling. However, a clearer justification regarding sample size calculation based on expected effect sizes and statistical power would strengthen the validity of the findings. A power analysis should ideally be included to confirm that the sample size is sufficient to detect the anticipated changes in FC.\n\n3. **Statistical Analysis for Within-Subject Design:**\n   - Given that this is a within-subjects design comparing the effects of Psilocybin and Salvinorin-A, it would be useful to further clarify if residuals were checked for normality and homoscedasticity. Any violations of these assumptions should be acknowledged, along with the approach taken to address them (e.g., use of non-parametric tests).\n\n4. **Confounding Variables:**\n   - The paper discusses ventilation as a confounding variable for Salvinorin-A but lacks a thorough statistical approach for addressing potential confounds arising from variations in drug dosage and timing. Including a model that accounts for these variables or a sensitivity analysis would make the findings more robust. \n\n5. **Illustration of Results:**\n   - Although figures demonstrate significant changes in FC, it would enhance clarity if effect sizes (e.g., Cohen's d) were reported alongside traditional p-values. This would provide additional context regarding the magnitude of the effects observed.\n\n6. **Supporting Information:**\n   - The associated supporting information should include detailed statistical outputs (e.g., means, standard deviations, confidence intervals) from the main tests employed. This information is crucial for readers who may want to replicate the findings.\n\n### Conclusion\nOverall, while the statistical analysis appears generally sound, addressing the points above could enhance the rigor, reproducibility, and clarity of the findings presented in this paper.

Here are some points regarding the novelty of the paper:\n\n1. **Comparative Analysis**: The study is notable for its comparative approach between psilocybin and salvinorin-A within the same subject pool (nonhuman primates). This dual characterization represents a significant advance in understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of different classes of hallucinogens. Prior studies have largely focused on one class or the other, making this comparative aspect innovative and a potential framework for future research.\n\n2. **Focus on Functional Connectivity**: The examination of FC changes in the context of hallucinogens is an area of increasing interest, yet it has often been limited to individual substances. By elucidating the acute effects on FC in specific neural circuits, particularly in relation to the claustrum and default mode network (DMN), this work enhances our understanding of the neural correlates associated with the subjective experiences induced by different hallucinogenic substances.\n\n3. **Identification of Common Mechanisms**: The authors propose overlapping mechanisms involved in the modulation of FC across different hallucinogens, suggesting a commonality despite differences in pharmacological profiles. This conceptual advancement could lead to broader implications for how hallucinogens affect consciousness and cognitive function, presenting a novel theoretical contribution to the field.\n\n4. **Clinical Implications**: The findings hold considerable implications for the exploration of therapeutic applications of hallucinogens in psychiatric disorders. While the novelty here is not solely in identifying new drug effects, it does provide useful insights that could guide future clinical applications and research into tailored therapeutic strategies based on specific hallucinogen profiles.\n\n5. **Contribution to Existing Literature**: The paper stands out by addressing gaps in the existing literature concerning the differential effects of hallucinogens on brain networks.

                "review": "### Review of Ethical Concerns in the Paper: \n\n**Title:** *Acute Effects of Hallucinogens on Functional Connectivity: Psilocybin and Salvinorin-A*\n\n**Authors:** Frederick A. Bagdasarian, Hanne D. Hansen, Jingyuan Chen, Chi-Hyeon Yoo, Michael S. Placzek, Jacob M. Hooker, and Hsiao-Ying Wey\n\n---\n\nThe ethical considerations in this study are crucial due to the use of nonhuman primates (NHPs) in drug experimentation. Below are some specific ethical concerns and recommendations:\n\n1. **Justification for Animal Use**: The paper adequately mentions that the study is justified by the translational relevance of NHPs to human pharmacology. However, a more explicit discussion is necessary regarding how the insights gained from the study could directly benefit human health or reduce suffering in psychiatric populations. Emphasizing the potential societal benefits might strengthen the ethical justification for animal use.\n\n2. **Welfare of Subjects**: The study states that the NHPs were under the supervision of a veterinarian and that physiological parameters were monitored. It is vital to ensure that the criteria used for monitoring their welfare are comprehensive. The authors should consider detailing the specific measures in place to minimize distress or pain, and the criteria for determining the welfare of the animals during the study must be transparently reported.\n\n3. **Informed Consent**: While informed consent is not applicable to animal research in the same manner as to human subjects, ethical standards necessitate that researchers consider the sentience and potential suffering of the animals involved. The research proposal should reflect adherence to the \"3Rs\" (Replacement, Reduction, Refinement) of animal research. A discussion of efforts to refine methodologies to minimize distress or harm, and the rationale for their chosen experimental protocols, would enhance ethical transparency.\n\n4. **Potential for Harm**: The authors should further elaborate on the potential short and long-term effects of the hallucinogenic substances administered, not only for the human correlate but also considering the immediate impact on NHPs. The report implies careful monitoring, which is commendable, yet it should emphasize assurances that there were protocols in place to handle any adverse reactions.\n\n5. **Study Limitations**: The limitations regarding the health of NHPs, particularly concerning timing between drug administration, should be further explored. Discussing how these limitations could potentially influence the study outcomes can reveal a nuanced engagement with ethical considerations, maintaining transparency about the implications of the study's design on animal welfare.\n\n6. **Long-term Impact on Animal Populations**: The potential future implications of using compounds like psilocybin and Salvinorin-A on animal populations (if these substances were ever to be adopted more broadly) should also be reflected upon. Are there ethical considerations for the continuation of practices that could affect wildlife if these drugs become more commonly used?\n\n7. **Ethical Oversight**: Mentioning the approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) is positive; however, it would be beneficial to outline any additional ethical oversight mechanisms, such as independent review boards or considerations from animal rights groups, indicating that ethical reflection extends beyond institutional compliance.\n\n8. **Transparency in Funding Sources**: Given that funding comes from various sources, including Atai Life Sciences, transparency about potential conflicts of interest is essential. An acknowledgment of how funding might impact the research objectives or methodologies can shed light on biases that may exist.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe study presents significant scientific exploration of hallucinogens using animal models, contributing to a developing area of research. Nevertheless, addressing these ethical concerns with more comprehensive details and reflections as discussed would not only strengthen the ethical integrity of the research but also foster wider acceptance and understanding of this sensitive subject matter among the scientific community and the public."

The use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) combined with a within-subject design allows for direct comparisons between the two hallucinogens, which is a significant strength of the study.\n\n#### Positive Aspects\n1. **Animal Model Selection**: Rhesus macaques are well-suited for this type of neuroimaging study due to their neurological similarities to humans. This choice enhances the translational relevance of the findings.\n\n2. **Anesthesia and Monitoring**: The use of a well-defined anesthetic protocol (isoflurane maintenance with monitoring of vital signs) is commendable. This is crucial for ensuring animal welfare and minimizing confounding variables related to physiological changes during drug administration.\n\n3. **Imaging Techniques**: The combination of T1-weighted MPRAGE and EPI sequences for functional imaging is appropriate and follows best practices in neuroimaging. Additionally, the use of a BrainPET insert indicates a robust imaging setup for assessing functional connectivity.\n\n4. **Preprocessing Pipeline**: The detailed preprocessing steps, including motion correction and nuisance regression, are essential for robust statistical analysis. The authors correctly employed typical fMRI preprocessing techniques, which should contribute to the validity of their findings.\n\n5. **Statistical Analysis**: The use of paired t-tests for comparing pre- and post-drug Z-scores, along with corrections for multiple comparisons, is a sound statistical approach. The authors provide robustness to their findings through this method.\n\n#### Areas for Improvement\n1. **Sample Size**: The study includes a relatively small sample size (three monkeys), which raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings. While the within-subject design mitigates some of this concern, a larger sample size would strengthen the statistical power and the reliability of the results.\n\n2. **Dose Variation**: The differing dosages between psilocybin and salvinorin-A, while stated to be necessary due to the nature of the original studies, may introduce variability that complicates the interpretation of comparative effects. A more systematic approach to dose selection for both substances would enhance the clarity of results.\n\n3. **Timing Between Drug Challenges**: The time intervals between drug challenges varied for each subject, with potential confounding effects on functional connectivity. It would be beneficial to consider a more standardized washout period between different drug administrations to allow for a clearer distinction in the observed effects.\n\n4. **Nuisance Variable Management**: While the authors did conduct nuisance regression, the impacts of the ventilation on functional signals should be addressed more thoroughly. Specific analysis examining how ventilation may influence connectivity results would lead to a more robust interpretation of the data.\n\n5. **Descriptive Statistics**: Alongside reporting effect sizes from the statistical tests, including descriptive statistics on the baseline characteristics and any potential outliers in functional connectivity measures prior to drug administration would enhance the transparency of the analysis.\n\n6. **Clarification of Seed Selection**: While the regions of interest (ROIs) are justified based on previous literature, a clearer rationale for the selection of specific seeds (e.g., why the claustrum and thalamus were chosen specifically) would strengthen the framework for understanding the underlying mechanisms of hallucinogenic effects.\n\n#### Conclusion\nOverall, the methodology employed in this study is thorough and establishes a sound basis for understanding the differential effects of psilocybin and salvinorin-A on functional connectivity. Addressing the highlighted areas for improvement, particularly concerning sample size, dose standardization, and the control of confounding variables, would enhance the robustness of the findings and enable more definitive conclusions regarding the hallucinogenic interactions under examination."

Below are key points regarding the interpretation of the results:\n\n1. **Comparison of Functional Connectivity**: The authors effectively highlight the unique and overlapping modulations of functional connectivity (FC) induced by Psilocybin and Salvinorin-A, emphasizing alterations in the claustrum and angular gyrus. However, it would strengthen the interpretation if the authors further articulated the functional implications of these changes\u2014how do these alterations in FC relate to subjective experiences of hallucination or self-identity dissolution? Discussing the behavioral correlates of these connectivity changes would add depth to the understanding.\n\n2. **Cortico-Claustro-Cortico Network Hypothesis**: The mention of the \"cortico-claustro-cortico\" (CCC) network is well-founded, as it builds on existing theories. However, the connection between increased FC in the claustrum and cognitive functions needs a clearer articulation of how these findings relate to prior literature on the claustrum as a hub for consciousness. For instance, how does this support or challenge existing notions of the claustrum's role in encoding subjective experiences?\n\n3. **Dissociation of the DMN**: The interpretation of the DMN's dissociation, particularly with distinct patterns observed in both substances, is fundamental. Yet, it lacks a discussion on the clinical relevance of these findings. Specifically, how does understanding DMN connectivity changes contribute to the therapeutic potential of these hallucinogens for psychological disorders? Encouraging a dialogue on how these findings might inform treatment or understanding of conditions like depression or PTSD would be relevant.\n\n4. **Limitations and Future Implications**: While the results section briefly mentions limitations (e.g., the variability in dosage and autonomic influences), the interpretation could benefit from a deeper reflection on how these limitations might affect the generalizability of the findings. A more thorough explication of how future studies might address these limitations could enhance the credibility and impact of the research.\n\n5. **Conclusions and Broader Mechanistic Insights**: The concluding remarks suggest that there may be broader mechanisms at work across different hallucinogen classes. However, the authors might clarify how these results could be extrapolated beyond this study. For instance, providing examples from the literature on other hallucinogens or different receptor targets may illustrate the potential for universal mechanisms, which could be impactful for future research directions.\n\nOverall, while the results provide a solid foundation for understanding the relative impacts of Psilocybin and Salvinorin-A, a more nuanced interpretation that connects neuronal changes to cognitive and clinical outcomes, addresses limitations comprehensively, and situates findings within the broader context of hallucinogenic research would enhance the paper significantly."

The authors have articulated a robust framework for understanding the biological mechanisms underlying these changes in connectivity, but several aspects of the functional connectivity framework could be enhanced for clarity and depth.\n\n#### Key Observations and Suggestions:\n\n1. **Clarity of Neural Mechanisms**:\n   - The paper commonly refers to the \"cortico-claustro-cortical (CCC)\" circuit. While this is a compelling concept, the framework would benefit from elaborating on how exactly these circuits vary between drugs that act on different receptor systems. A thorough explanation of the interaction between the claustrum and other cortical areas could provide more insight into its role as a \"conductor\" of subjective consciousness during hallucinogenic states.\n\n2. **Comparative Analysis**:\n   - The distinction between serotonergic and non-serotonergic hallucinogens is a central theme of the study. However, a clearer side-by-side comparison of their mechanistic pathways could enhance understanding. For example, emphasizing how the connectivity changes differ in terms of cortical versus thalamic interactions for each drug would highlight potential pharmacological nuances.\n\n3. **Use of Statistical Methods**:\n   - The choice of paired t-tests for assessing FC changes is appropriate, but the framework could be strengthened by addressing the potential limitations of this statistical method, especially given the complexities of FC data. Consider discussing the implications of multiple comparisons more explicitly, and why particular thresholds (e.g., *p* < 0.05) were chosen.\n\n4. **Integration with Current Literature**:\n   - While the authors reference existing literature, integrating more comparative analyses with recent studies on other hallucinogens could help contextualize findings. It would strengthen claims about DMN desynchronization by drawing on recent fMRI literature and connectivity analyses.\n\n5. **Impact of External Factors**:\n   - The paper does contemplate limitations due to physiological factors, such as ventilation management and timing of scans. Discussing these confounders explicitly in the context of their potential impact on FC could help frame the findings more robustly. It would also be beneficial to explore how these factors could affect the reproducibility of results in future studies.\n\n6. **Visualizations and Interpretation**:\n   - Figures illustrating connectivity changes are vital for interpretation, but consider augmenting these with clearer legends that directly correlate figures to the narrative. Further illustrations that depict the hypothesized mechanisms could enhance reader comprehension.\n\n7. **Functional Significance**:\n   - The paper primarily reports changes in connectivity without delving deeply into the functional significance of these changes. A discussion on how alterations in preferences for certain neural pathways relate to behavioral or subjective experiences would offer a more holistic understanding of the drugs\u2019 effects.\n\n8. **Future Directions**:\n   - While you mention future studies and mechanisms to explore, providing specific hypotheses based on your findings\u2014such as potential applications in treating psychiatric disorders\u2014could greatly strengthen the predictive capacity of your functional connectivity framework.\n\nOverall, this study provides exciting insights into the functional connectivity changes associated with hallucinogens and contributes valuable knowledge to the field. With minor enhancements in clarity, depth, and contextual linking to existing literature, the functional connectivity framework can be made more robust and informative."

                "review": "### Feedback on the Neuroscientific Implications of the Paper\n\nThe study presents significant findings regarding the effects of the hallucinogens psilocybin and salvinorin-A on functional connectivity (FC) in the nonhuman primate (NHP) model. This research contributes to the growing body of literature that explores the intricate mechanisms of hallucinogenic substances and their effects on brain networks. Below are specific neuroscientific implications based on the findings of this paper:\n\n1. **Role of the Claustrum in Hallucinogenic States**:\n   The results underscore the claustrum's role as a pivotal structure implicated in mediating altered states of consciousness induced by hallucinogens. The increased FC between the claustrum and cortical regions seen with both substances supports theories that frame the claustrum as a \"conductor\" of consciousness. This aligns with prior literature suggesting the claustrum's involvement in integrating sensory information and modulating cognitive functions.\n\n2. **Differential Thalamic Connectivity**:\n   The study highlights a clear distinction between serotonergic and non-serotonergic hallucinogens concerning thalamic connectivity. Psilocybin resulted in significant changes in thalamic connectivity to sensory networks, likely due to its action on 5-HT2 receptors, which may not be applicable to salvinorin-A. This differential connectivity provides insights into how varying pharmacological profiles of hallucinogens can lead to unique alterations in sensory processing and cognitive integration.\n\n3. **Impact on the Default Mode Network (DMN)**:\n   Both hallucinogens induced dissociations within the DMN, a network often associated with self-referential thought. The observed reductions in FC within the DMN suggest a possible mechanism for the ego dissolution that users frequently report during hallucinogenic experiences. Understanding how these substances modulate the DMN could further elucidate their therapeutic potential in treating disorders characterized by hyperactivity in this network, such as depression and anxiety disorders.\n\n4. **Common Mechanisms in Hallucinogens**:\n   The paper proposes an interesting hypothesis regarding overlapping mechanisms among hallucinogens, notably the functional dissociation from the angular gyrus to frontal cortical areas. This suggests that regardless of the underlying pharmacology, there may be foundational pathways through which hallucinogens exert their psychoactive effects. This concept is significant for both clinical and research avenues, paving the way for broader applications in understanding various cognitive disorders.\n\n5. **Implications for Psychiatric Disorders**:\n   The findings may have direct implications for treating psychiatric conditions wherein hallucinations or altered states of consciousness occur, such as schizophrenia or severe depression. By mapping out the specific FC changes brought upon by these hallucinogens, researchers may derive novel therapeutic strategies that leverage these effects for clinical benefits.\n\n6. **Model Validity and Future Directions**:\n   Conducting this study in NHPs contributes to the ecological validity of the findings, seeing as primate models often provide insight translatable to human subjects. Future investigations might focus on longitudinal studies assessing the long-term effects of hallucinogens on brain connectivity or combining fMRI with electrophysiological recordings to achieve a deeper understanding of real-time dynamics during hallucinogenic states.\n\n### Conclusion\nOverall, this study provides important neuroscientific insights into the differential effects of hallucinogens on brain connectivity, especially concerning classical psychedelics like psilocybin and kappa-opioid agonists like salvinorin-A. By identifying shared and unique mechanisms that affect consciousness and cognitive processing, the authors contribute valuable knowledge that expands both theoretical understanding and practical applications in mental health treatments. Future research that builds upon these findings will be essential in further disentangling the complex interactions between hallucinogenic compounds and neurophysiological processes."

                "review": "### Feedback on Novelty\n\nThe paper entitled \"Acute Effects of Hallucinogens on Functional Connectivity: Psilocybin and Salvinorin\u2011A\" addresses a highly pertinent area in the field of psychopharmacology by comparing the acute effects of two distinct hallucinogens\u2014psilocybin (a serotonergic compound) and salvinorin-A (a kappa-opioid receptor agonist)\u2014on functional connectivity (FC) in the brain of nonhuman primates (NHPs). Here are my observations regarding the novelty of the paper:\n\n#### Strengths:\n\n1. **Comparative Approach**: This is the first study to directly compare the differential and overlapping effects of a serotonergic hallucinogen (psilocybin) and a non-serotonergic hallucinogen (salvinorin-A) on functional connectivity in real-time, within the same organisms. This within-subject design is particularly significant and enhances the relevance of the findings to broader psychopharmacological discussions.\n\n2. **Focus on Functional Connectivity**: The investigation into functional connectivity using fMRI to delineate the specific neural mechanisms by which these drugs operate is a promising avenue for understanding the neurophysiological foundations of hallucinogenic experiences. Emphasizing the claustral-cortical and thalamo-cortical circuits presents a refreshing perspective that adds depth to the existing literature.\n\n3. **Framework for Future Research**: By establishing a framework that distinguishes between the effects of serotonergic and non-serotonergic hallucinogens and suggesting a shared common pathway related to connectivity changes, this study lays important groundwork for future investigations into the mechanisms of hallucinogens and their potential therapeutic applications.\n\n#### Areas for Improvement:\n\n1. **Contextual Novelty**: While the comparative approach is novel, the examination of functional connectivity changes across various hallucinogens is a growing field. Clarifying how this specific study adds uniquely to the existing literature on both psilocybin and salvinorin-A would strengthen claims of novelty. For example, providing more context about previously published data on salvinorin-A's brain effects would be beneficial.\n\n2. **Mechanistic Insights**: Although the study hints at shared mechanisms through the analysis of brain connectivity, more focus on the underlying biological mechanisms\u2014such as the specific neurotransmitter interactions and receptor-mediated effects\u2014could bolster the novelty by linking observed connectivity patterns to biochemical pathways.\n\n3. **Limitations Acknowledgment**: The authors mention certain limitations (e.g., concerns over anesthetic effects and sample size) that may influence findings. A more extensive discussion on how these limitations could affect the interpretation of novelty and robustness of conclusions would contribute to a balanced perspective.\n\nIn summary, the study presents significant advancements in understanding the functional connectivity implications of two different classes of hallucinogens, which is relatively unexplored territory. By emphasizing the distinctions and commonalities in their effects, it opens new avenues for research that could enhance therapeutic applications. Clearer contextualization of its novelty alongside a robust discussion of limitations will further solidify its contribution to the field."

                "review": "### Feedback on Ethical Concerns\n\nThe paper titled \"Acute Effects of Hallucinogens on Functional Connectivity: Psilocybin and Salvinorin\u2011A\" raises several ethical considerations regarding the use of nonhuman primates (NHPs) in research, particularly in drug studies involving psychoactive substances:\n\n1. **Welfare of Nonhuman Primates**: The welfare of the three male rhesus macaques used in this study is paramount. While the authors note that all procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), further details about the specific welfare protocols and monitoring during drug administration would enhance the ethical transparency of the study. Any stress or discomfort experienced by the animals should be minimized as much as possible and actively monitored.\n\n2. **Informed Consent and Justification**: While informed consent is typically not applicable to animal research, it is essential that a strong justification is provided for the use of NHPs rather than alternative models (e.g., rodents). The authors should emphasize the unique advantages of studying nonhuman primates in this context, particularly concerning the translational relevance of findings to human conditions.\n\n3. **Risks and Benefits**: The study should thoroughly outline the potential risks involved in administering hallucinogenic substances to NHPs. An open dialogue about the possible adverse effects on their health and wellbeing, alongside a balanced discussion of the anticipated scientific and medical benefits, is crucial in assessing the ethical validity of the research.\n\n4. **Recovery Monitoring**: The authors assert that all NHPs recovered successfully after experiments, yet it would be beneficial to provide more detailed observations about the recovery phase post-drug administration. This includes monitoring behavior, health changes, and psychological impacts in the days following the experiments.\n\n5. **Environmental Enrichment**: There is minimal mention of the living conditions and environmental enrichment provided for the NHPs. Ensuring that these animals are housed in environments that promote natural behaviors and cognitive stimulation is necessary for ethical animal research.\n\n6. **Alternatives to Invasive Procedures**: There could be a discussion on whether non-invasive or less invasive imaging techniques could be utilized, especially considering the advancements in technology that might allow for such methods. The authors should address this concern and clarify the rationale for their specific methodologies.\n\n7. **Long-Term Impacts**: The long-term effects of both psilocybin and salvinorin-A on the NHPs should be addressed. Ethical considerations would benefit from an outline of any follow-up procedures to ascertain long-term health impacts post-experimentation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the study aims to contribute valuable insights into the effects of hallucinogens on functional connectivity, addressing these ethical considerations with greater depth will enhance the integrity and acceptability of the research. The authors are encouraged to be transparent about their animal welfare practices and to explore potential alternatives that may minimize the impact on the subjects involved."

                "review": "### Feedback on Methodology\n\nThe methodology section of the paper \"Acute Effects of Hallucinogens on Functional Connectivity: Psilocybin and Salvinorin-A\" provides a detailed and largely clear account of the experimental design, animal procedures, imaging techniques, and data analysis approaches. However, several key aspects can be improved or clarified for greater scientific rigor and reproducibility.\n\n1. **Animal Selection and Number:**\n   - The study employs three male rhesus macaques, which may limit the generalizability of the findings due to the small sample size. A more robust sample size would strengthen the statistical validity of the conclusions drawn. Including additional animals would also help account for individual variability in responses to the hallucinogens.\n\n2. **Anesthesia and Monitoring:**\n   - While the use of xylazine and ketamine for initial anesthesia, followed by isoflurane maintenance, is appropriate, it raises concerns regarding the potential influence of anesthesia on functional connectivity (FC) measurements. The authors should provide a rationale for their choice of anesthetic protocol and discuss any literature that supports the validity of FC measurements under these conditions.\n\n3. **Drug Administration Protocol:**\n   - The variability in dosages of Psilocybin and Salvinorin-A across subjects is noted as a limitation due to the small sample size. The authors could consider standardizing dosages or providing a clear justification for the choice of dosages based on prior studies to enhance clarity regarding the effects of different drug concentrations.\n\n4. **Timing of Drug Administration:**\n   - The authors note the instances of scans occurring within varying time frames (e.g., 21 or 14 days apart). This pseudorandom application may introduce confounding effects that merit further explanation. A discussion on how the timing may affect the functional connectivity results would be beneficial.\n\n5. **fMRI Preprocessing:**\n   - The methodology for fMRI preprocessing is generally well-structured. However, details about the specific parameters of the nuisance regression (e.g., type/number of motion correction parameters if averaged) should be included for reproducibility. Providing the thresholds for including/excluding subjects based on motion (e.g., framewise displacement) would also enhance transparency.\n\n6. **Statistical Analysis:**\n   - The statistical analysis section mentions using a paired t-test with corrections for multiple comparisons. Including more details on the specific correction methods employed (e.g., Bonferroni, False Discovery Rate) and justifying the selection of these methods relative to the data distribution would improve the robustness of the analytical approach.\n\n7. **Visualization of Data and Results:**\n   - While the figures included are helpful, elaborating on how the figures interrelate to the results discussed in the text would strengthen the presentation. Cross-referencing specific results with their corresponding figures directly in the discussion could provide clarity to readers interpreting the findings.\n\n8. **Limitations and Future Directions:**\n   - The study does a good job of outlining limitations, particularly concerning the effects of ventilation and timing on FC measurements. More could be added regarding potential biases introduced by the animal model itself and how findings may or may not translate to human studies. Recommendations for future studies could also explicitly highlight how to address these limitations.\n\nIn conclusion, while the methodology demonstrates a solid foundational approach to investigating the effects of hallucinogens on functional connectivity, addressing the above points would enhance the clarity, robustness, and reproducibility of the study. Overall, there is a compelling framework here that, with some refinement, can provide significant insights into the field of psychedelic research."
