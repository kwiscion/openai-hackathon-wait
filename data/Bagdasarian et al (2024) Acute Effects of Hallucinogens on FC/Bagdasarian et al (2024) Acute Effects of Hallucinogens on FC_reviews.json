                "review": "### Feedback on Results Interpretation\n\nThe interpretation of results presented in the paper on acute effects of hallucinogens on functional connectivity\u2014specifically psilocybin and salvinorin-A\u2014can be evaluated based on clarity, depth of analysis, and coherence with existing literature.\n\n1. **Clarity and Coherence**: \n   The authors effectively delineate the results of their fMRI analysis, noting significant increases and decreases in functional connectivity (FC) associated with the claustrum, thalamus, DMN, and PFC. However, the narrative can sometimes be complex, potentially obscuring key findings. Simplifying some of the sections and ensuring a clear linkage between results and their physiological interpretations could enhance comprehension. For instance, the statement regarding the claustrum being a \"conductor\" of subjective consciousness could be better contextualized to clarify its relevance in the discussion of hallucinogenic states.\n\n2. **Integration with Existing Literature**: \n   The authors have made commendable efforts to connect their findings with previous studies, which supports the broader narrative of hallucinogenic effects on connectivity. There are appropriate references to other studies comparing similar hallucinogens and their impacts, particularly regarding DMN desynchronization. However, when integrating previous works, ensuring that these comparisons are robust and that any discrepancies are acknowledged would strengthen the discussion. For instance, elaborating upon how their findings on thalamic connectivity diverge from or align with studies focused on other psychedelics could provide greater insight.\n\n3. **Mechanistic Insights**: \n   The results section compellingly suggests mechanistic insights into how hallucinogens may induce alterations in cognitive processing. The distinction between serotonergic (psilocybin) and non-serotonergic (salvinorin-A) hallucinogens adds a valuable dimension to the interpretation. Yet, more clarity could be added regarding the implications of these differences\u2014specifically, how does each drug\u2019s distinct impact on thalamic connectivity inform our understanding of their psychological or neural effects? Addressing this could bolster the significance of the findings.\n\n4. **Discussion of Findings on Specific Regions**: \n   The discussion surrounding specific regions like the angular gyrus and its computational implications in self-perception is intriguing but would benefit from further elaboration. For example, elucidating why reduced FC in the angular gyrus correlates with altered self-identification could enhance the understanding of the subjective experiences reported by users of these substances. Additionally, tying these findings back to potential clinical implications could establish a more direct relevance to psychiatric disorders.\n\n5. **Limitations Acknowledgment**: \n   The authors briefly touch on some limitations, such as sample size and the effects of ventilation during Salvinorin-A administration. More detailed acknowledgment of how these limitations may affect the interpretation of results could improve the transparency of the research. Furthermore, discussing potential confounding variables in greater detail and how they were accounted for in the analysis could strengthen the integrity of the findings.\n\n6. **Future Research Directions**: \n   While the authors conclude with suggestions for future studies, emphasizing specific hypotheses or experimental designs could make their call for future research more actionable. For instance, proposing avenues to further dissect the interactions in the claustral-cortical network could be beneficial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOverall, the results section presents significant findings with potential implications for understanding the effects of hallucinogens on functional connectivity. However, the interpretation could be refined with clearer linkage to existing literature, more thorough implications for clinical contexts, and an enhanced discussion of the mechanisms involved. These adjustments would provide a more compelling narrative and contribute to broader discussions within the field."

                "review": "### Statistical Analysis Review\n\nThe statistical analysis in this paper entitled \"Acute Effects of Hallucinogens on Functional Connectivity: Psilocybin and Salvinorin\u2011A\" is generally sound, but there are a few areas that require clarification or improvement to enhance the rigor of the findings.\n\n1. **Statistical Testing Methodology**:\n   - The paper utilizes paired t-tests to compare pre-drug and post-drug functional connectivity (FC) changes for different hallucinogens. While this approach is appropriate for analyzing dependent samples, the justification of this choice and its implications should be discussed more thoroughly. Specifically, how does using paired t-tests account for potential confounders such as the variability in drug effects among individual subjects, and what assumptions inherent in this statistical method might impact interpretations of the results? \n\n2. **Correction for Multiple Comparisons**:\n   - The authors mention correcting for multiple comparisons by applying a significance threshold of \\( p < 0.05 \\) and cluster-forming correction at \\( Z > 2.3 \\). However, it is vital to specify what methods were used for this correction (e.g., Bonferroni correction, FDR, etc.). A more comprehensive description of how the correction was conducted, including operational details, will help readers assess the validity of the reported significance levels and the risk of Type I error.\n\n3. **Reporting of Effect Sizes**:\n   - In addition to reporting p-values, providing effect sizes (e.g., Cohen's d, partial \u03b7\u00b2) would greatly strengthen the analysis. It would offer insights into the magnitude of the observed effects, facilitating a better understanding of their practical significance beyond mere statistical significance.\n\n4. **Handling of Sample Size and Power Analysis**:\n   - The manuscript mentions that the sample size was limited to three male rhesus macaques, which raises concerns about statistical power. It would be beneficial for the authors to include a power analysis to justify that the current sample size was adequate to detect expected effects. If future studies are anticipated, a projected sample size based on preliminary data should be provided.\n\n5. **Description of Preprocessing Steps**:\n   - While the authors outline some preprocessing steps in the methods section, a more detailed account of the preprocessing (including how residual errors were managed) could ensure reproducibility. Additionally, discussing the rationale behind these preprocessing steps and their potential impact on the statistical results would add depth to the analysis portion of this paper.\n\n6. **Clarification on Functional Connectivity Measures**:\n   - The manuscript states that they computed voxel-wise correlations with seed regions of interest (ROIs). It would be helpful to elaborate further on the selection criteria for ROIs and how the authors accounted for resting state variability that may confound the FC measures.\n\n7. **Discussion on Limitations**:\n   - In the limitations section, the authors briefly mention that drug doses and user experiences were not included as covariates. Given the potential inter-subject variability in drug response, addressing how this might influence connectivity results should be a focal point of discussion in more depth.\n\n### Conclusion\nOverall, the statistical framework used in this paper provides a good foundation for the findings reported, but clarity on several key aspects, including multiple comparisons correction, effect size, sample size justification, and in-depth preprocessing details, will improve the rigor and transparency of the analysis. Addressing these observations will enhance the readers' trust in the findings and encourage further discussion on the implications for understanding the effects of hallucinogens on functional connectivity in cognitive processes."

                "review": "### Feedback on Neuroanatomical Insights\n\nThe neuroanatomical insights provided in this paper on the effects of Psilocybin and Salvinorin-A on functional connectivity (FC) offer a compelling examination of how these hallucinogens alter brain network dynamics. The thorough investigation of key brain regions\u2014namely the claustrum, prefrontal cortex (PFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and angular gyrus\u2014strengthens the authors\u2019 arguments regarding the overlapping and distinctive modulations induced by these compounds.\n\n#### Strengths\n\n1. **Innovative Approach**: This study is noteworthy for its within-subject design comparing two distinct classes of hallucinogens (serotonergic vs. non-serotonergic) in a nonhuman primate model, which enhances translational relevance to human studies.\n  \n2. **Implications of Claustrum**: The emphasis on the claustrum as a pivotal hub in hallucinogenic action is particularly insightful. The findings that both drugs enhance FC between the claustrum and the frontal cortex align well with existing literature and contribute to the understanding of the claustrum's role in consciousness modulation.\n\n3. **Functional Connectivity Changes**: The nuanced interpretation of DMN desynchronization, particularly pertaining to the ACC and angular gyrus, adds depth to existing literature. The identification of shared patterns of disruption in FC suggests potential common mechanisms driven by these compounds, regardless of their specific receptor targets.\n\n4. **Discussion of Thalamic Connectivity**: The segregation of corticothalamic connectivity effects between the two drugs offers significant insights into how different hallucinogen classes may interact with sensory processing pathways differently. The paper elegantly links these differences to 5-HT2AR activation.\n\n#### Areas for Improvement\n\n1. **Broader Implications for Clinical Applications**: While the findings contribute valuable knowledge to the neuroanatomy of hallucinogenic effects, the authors could further discuss how these insights may guide future therapeutic applications beyond psychiatric disorders. For instance, addressing whether specific connectivity patterns could predict treatment responses or adverse effects would be advantageous.\n\n2. **Clarification of DMN Specificity**: The distinction made regarding the DMN's specificity in relation to drug classes could use more elaboration in the context of neuroplasticity theories. Future research could focus on the long-term neuroanatomical changes linked to repeated hallucinogen exposure, which may affect DMN functioning and connectivity.\n\n3. **Limitations and Future Directions**: The authors do mention several limitations, yet a more detailed exploration into how these could influence the interpretation of results would be beneficial. Specifically, a deeper discussion on how pharmacokinetics and individual variability (e.g., receptor density or functional genetic polymorphisms) could affect FC in future studies could enhance the robustness of the conclusions.\n\n4. **Detailed Methodology**: While the methods section provides a general breakdown of the imaging and analysis protocols, including more detailed descriptions of the statistical measures and controls would enhance reproducibility. It's critical to discuss the implications of potential confounding factors, such as the timing and dosage of drug administration, in greater detail.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of psychedelic research by elucidating the neuroanatomical correlates of hallucinogen-induced changes in functional connectivity.

Given the nature of the research, several ethical considerations must be addressed:\n\n1. **Use of Nonhuman Primates**: The choice to utilize rhesus macaques as subjects raises significant ethical concerns, particularly surrounding animal welfare. While the researchers state that all procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), the potential for distress, pain, and long-term harm to the animals must be thoroughly justifiable. The study must articulate explicitly why such invasive research in nonhuman primates is necessary compared to other models or methods. The researchers should consider further exploring alternative methods, such as computational models or in vitro studies, that might reduce or eliminate the need for animal involvement.\n\n2. **Anesthesia and Monitoring**: The paper mentions that the animals were anesthetized and monitored throughout the experiments. Ethical research involving animals must ensure that the anesthesia and any pharmacological agents used do not adversely affect the animals' long-term health or well-being. Clarity on how the researchers ensured the minimum level of distress and a detailed account of the monitoring process can bolster the ethical framework of the study.\n\n3. **Dosage and Safety**: The paper states varying dosages of both Psilocybin and Salvinorin-A were administered. Ethical considerations are paramount when administering psychoactive substances, especially given the potential for unknown adverse effects. The paper should include a clear rationale for the chosen dosages, their expected effects, and how potential risks to animal health were mitigated.\n\n4. **Post-experiment Welfare**: The study notes that all nonhuman primates recovered successfully after experimentation. Comprehensive post-experimental monitoring practices should be described in more detail, ensuring the psychological and physical well-being of the animals during recovery. Furthermore, the long-term impacts of the study on animal welfare, such as behavioral changes post-experimentation, should be addressed.\n\n5. **Justification of Research Purpose**: While the study aims to explore the implications of hallucinogens for understanding psychiatric disorders, it is essential for the authors to contextualize the potential benefits of this research in relation to ethical considerations. The discussion of how this knowledge might translate into improvements in mental health treatment must be robust and proportionate to the ethical burden the research imposes on the subjects.\n\n6. **Transparency and Replicability**: Ethical research also involves being transparent about protocols and ensuring that the findings can be rigorously evaluated and replicated. The authors should include detailed methods and considerations involving the ethical treatment of animal subjects to promote trust in the research's ethical integrity.\n\nIn summary, while the pursuit of knowledge in understanding hallucinogens is valuable, the ethical treatment of nonhuman primates in this context requires diligent consideration. It\u2019s crucial that the researchers prioritize animal welfare throughout the study, justify their methodologies comprehensively, and provide clarity on how the findings will potentially benefit both scientific understanding and animal welfare in future applications."

Below are several key points of feedback:\n\n1. **Sample Size and Animal Model**: The study utilized three male rhesus macaques, which may limit generalizability due to the small sample size. While the choice of NHPs is suitable given their anatomical and physiological similarities to humans, consider discussing the implications of such a limited sample size on statistical power and the reproducibility of results.\n\n2. **Drug Administration and Dosage**: The paper included varying dosages of Psilocybin and Salvinorin-A, chosen based on previous studies. It would benefit from a clearer rationale for the specific dosage selection and how these dosages compare to pharmacologically relevant human doses. Including a justification for the pseudorandom administration design would also enhance understanding of potential confounding variables.\n\n3. **Imaging Techniques**: The methodology for imaging (e.g., fMRI sequence parameters, anesthesia protocols) is well-described, but it could be improved by explicitly detailing how potential confounding factors, such as the effects of isoflurane anesthesia on functional connectivity, were addressed. It's critical to acknowledge the impact of anesthesia on brain activity and connectivity, particularly when interpreting the results.\n\n4. **Data Preprocessing**: The preprocessing pipeline is thorough, including steps like motion correction, skull stripping, and nuisance regression. However, the rationale for not differentiating the effect of ventilation on Salvinorin-A during analyses could be more explicitly stated, as this is a notable limitation. Discussing how this could have impacted the interpretation of the functional connectivity data would be beneficial.\n\n5. **Functional Connectivity Analysis**: The methods for calculating functional connectivity through seed-based analyses using specific ROIs are appropriate. However, elaborating on the choice of seeds and how previous literature supports their inclusion could help validate the approach. It may also be helpful to indicate if there were plans to examine network-level analyses beyond seed-based approaches in future studies.\n\n6. **Statistical Analysis**: The statistical methods, including paired t-tests and corrections for multiple comparisons, are adequately described. Future iterations could benefit from discussing how different methods of statistical analyses might impact results, especially given the relatively limited data set.\n\n7. **Limitations**: The authors correctly note significant limitations in their methodology, including variable resting times between drug challenges and the inherent challenges tied to drug effects on autonomic processes. Providing additional detail about how such variables were controlled or planned for in analysis could enhance robustness.\n\n8. **Generalizability and Future Directions**: The methodology would be strengthened by an outlook on how the findings may be applied or tested in future studies.

However, several areas in this section could benefit from clearer elucidation and refined context for the findings.\n\n1. **Clarity in Implications of FC Changes**: While the authors explain the observed FC changes following drug administration, they could enhance the discussion by better framing the implications of these changes. For instance, discussing how increases or decreases in specific connectivity patterns correlate with behavioral or subjective experiences linked to the hallucinogens could offer valuable insights. This could strengthen the connection between neural metrics and psychoactive effects.\n\n2. **Integration with Existing Literature**: The paper effectively references existing studies regarding the functional role of the claustrum, angular gyrus, and thalamus in hallucinogenic states. However, a more thorough integration of how these findings interface with broader neuroscientific literature would elevate the importance of the results. For instance, an explicit comparison between the hallucinogens' effects on these structures versus their known functions in cognition and perception would be useful.\n\n3. **Potential Mechanisms**: The emphasis on proposed mechanisms, such as thalamo-cortical connectivity being specific to serotonergic hallucinogens, could be further elaborated. Exploring the underlying biological mechanisms (e.g., receptor activation pathways) might clarify why certain functional changes occur with one substance but not the other. \n\n4. **Statistical Analysis Context**: The paper describes the statistical methods to assess functional connectivity but lacks a discussion about the robustness or limitations of the findings from these analyses.

The authors employed a well-structured approach to assess the functional connectivity (FC) changes induced by psilocybin and salvinorin-A in rhesus macaques. However, several areas could benefit from clarification and additional detail to enhance the transparency and reliability of the results.\n\n#### Specific Points for Improvement\n\n1. **Sample Size and Power Analysis**:\n   - The paper mentions the number of subjects used but does not provide a power analysis to determine if the sample size is sufficient to detect the expected effects. Including a power analysis would strengthen the validity of the conclusions drawn from the statistical tests.\n\n2. **Statistical Methods**:\n   - The authors employ paired t-tests for statistical comparisons of pre- and post-drug FC values. While this is a suitable method, it would be beneficial to justify why paired t-tests were chosen over other statistical methods such as mixed effects models, which could account for potential variances more effectively, especially with the small sample size.\n\n3. **Correction for Multiple Comparisons**:\n   - It is noted that the authors corrected for multiple comparisons with a significance level of p < 0.05 and a cluster-forming threshold of Z > 2.3. However, the specific method used for this correction (e.g., Bonferroni correction, false discovery rate) should be clearly stated in the methods section. This would clarify the robustness of the findings given the number of tests performed.\n\n4. **Statistical Assumptions**:\n   - The assumptions underlying the paired t-test should be addressed. For example, normality of the data should be checked (e.g., using a Shapiro-Wilk test or similar), and the authors could elaborate on how they assessed the homogeneity of variances.\n\n5. **Effect Sizes**:\n   - Reporting effect sizes (e.g., Cohen's d) alongside p-values would provide more context for the practical significance of the findings. This practice enhances the interpretability of the results and allows readers to gauge the magnitude of the observed effects.\n\n6. **Visualization of Results**:\n   - While figures illustrating the connectivity changes are present, providing additional statistical visualizations (e.g., distribution plots, histograms of the FC values post-drug) could improve the reader's understanding of the data assumption and spread.\n\n7. **Limitations of Statistical Analysis**:\n   - The authors briefly mention limitations relating to timing between drug challenges and baseline FC. Expanding on how this might influence the statistical outcomes would demonstrate a critical engagement with the data's limitations.\n\n8. **Bivariate Correlation and Multiple Variables**:\n   - If additional covariates or factors were measured (like physiological parameters), these should be analyzed to evaluate their potential effects on the functional connectivity changes. Including a multivariable regression analysis could clarify whether the effects observed are indeed due to drug administration or if they are confounded by other factors.\n\n#### Conclusion\nOverall, the statistical analysis employed in the manuscript is solid, but addressing the points outlined above would significantly enhance its transparency and credibility. Incorporating a clearer justification for statistical choices and presenting power analysis would assist readers in evaluating the rigor of the findings."

                "review": "### Feedback on the Discussion of Cognitive Implications\n\nThe paper presents compelling findings on the acute effects of psilocybin and salvinorin-A on functional connectivity (FC) within the brain, with a particular focus on areas like the claustrum, prefrontal cortex (PFC), and the angular gyrus. The discussion provides a thoughtful interpretation of these areas' involvement in the cognitive implications of hallucinogenic states. Here are several points to consider for enhancing clarity and depth:\n\n1. **Cognitive Connectivity and the Claustrum**:\n   - The paper effectively outlines how the claustrum may act as a \"conductor\" of consciousness, linking subjective experiences with cognitive processing. However, further elaboration on how disruptions within this network relate specifically to varying subjective effects of the hallucinogens (like enhanced creativity vs. anxiety) would strengthen your argument. Integrating current theories on cognitive functioning dependent on claustral connectivity could deepen the insights.\n\n2. **Rationale for Comparing Different Drug Classes**:\n   - While the study aims to elucidate similarities and differences between serotonergic and non-serotonergic hallucinogens, it would be beneficial to more explicitly discuss why this comparison is crucial in understanding broader cognitive implications. For example, discussing potential clinical applications, such as treating specific cognitive disorders or enhancing therapeutic interventions, could contextualize the importance of your findings.\n\n3. **Functional Dissociation of the Angular Gyrus**:\n   - The pointed analysis suggesting that dissociation from the angular gyrus contributes to hallucinogenic experiences is thought-provoking. Yet, it could be enhanced by discussing the underlying mechanisms that lead to differential connectivity patterns. Referencing existing literature that links the angular gyrus to self-perception or out-of-body experiences\u2014and how the drugs modulate these functions\u2014could provide a more comprehensive view.\n\n4. **Thalamocortical Connectivity**:\n   - The finding that thalamic connectivity may be specifically modulated by serotonergic hallucinogens stands out as a significant differentiation. However, an exploration of the cognitive processes affected by these thalamic connections could be added. For instance, discussing how alterations in sensory processing might relate to altered perceptual states would clarify the implications of this finding.\n\n5. **Implications for Computational Models**:\n   - The work hints at the need for computational models to understand the complexity of functional interactions better. Proposing potential frameworks or models that can incorporate the nuances of hallucinogenic effects on cognition and connectivity could serve as a pathway for future research. This prospect could unify results across diverse studies and lay the groundwork for hypothesis-driven research.\n\n6. **Future Directions**:\n   - The discussion concludes with a call for further exploration of the specific relationships between the claustrum, angular gyrus, and PFC. Including more concrete proposals for future experiments, such as neuroimaging studies in human populations or the use of computational modeling, would strengthen this concluding section. \n\n7. **Limitation Acknowledgment**:\n   - While the study limitations section is well-handled, integrating how these limitations might affect the discussion points about functional connectivity could further add nuance. For example, how might varying autonomic responses influence cognitive processing during the drug's effects?\n\nIn summary, the discussion on cognitive implications is substantial and engages deeply with the findings. By expanding on the cognitive narratives surrounding the claustrum and angular gyrus, addressing the significance of understanding different drug classes, articulating potential future research pathways, and considering the cognitive ramifications of thalamic alterations, the discussion could reach even greater depths of insight regarding the cognitive implications of hallucinogenic effects."

                "review": "## Novelty Review of the Paper: \"Acute Effects of Hallucinogens on Functional Connectivity: Psilocybin and Salvinorin-A\"\n\n### Summary of Findings\nThis paper presents a comparative analysis of the acute effects of the two hallucinogens, Psilocybin, and Salvinorin-A, on functional connectivity (FC) in the brains of rhesus macaques. The study is framed within the context of hallucinogens' potential therapeutic impacts on cognitive disorders and aims to identify common mechanisms of action between serotonergic and non-serotonergic hallucinogens.\n\n### Novelty Assessment\n\n1. **Comparative Analysis of Drug Classes**: \n   - The study is notable for its within-subject comparisons of a serotonergic hallucinogen (Psilocybin) and a non-serotonergic hallucinogen (Salvinorin-A). Previous research has primarily focused on either class of hallucinogens in isolation, making this comparative approach novel. It positions the research within a unique framework that could enhance understanding of drug-specific mechanisms and potentially broader hallucinogenic actions.\n\n2. **Focus on Functional Connectivity**: \n   - While functional connectivity studies are not rare, this paper specifically explores the acute desynchronization of the Default Mode Network (DMN) and highlights the unique pathways influenced by each drug. The identification of overlapping and distinct FC changes provides new insights into how different hallucinogens modulate brain activity, which is a relatively under-explored area.\n\n3. **Implication of the Claustrum**:\n   - The focus on the claustrum as a critical integrative hub in the hallucinogenic experience is particularly novel. By incorporating this structure into the analysis of FC changes, the research extends existing models of hallucinogenic action (such as the CCC model) by proposing an updated interpretation that includes both increased connectivity and specific dissociations involving the claustrum.\n\n4. **Integration of Animal Model Data**:\n   - Utilizing nonhuman primates allows for insights that may translate more effectively to human subjects than many rodent studies. This approach enhances the validity of the findings due to the anatomical and functional similarities between primates and humans, thereby contributing a new perspective to the field of psychoactive substance research.\n\n5. **Focus on Mechanistic Differences**: \n   - The analysis of mechanistic differences, particularly the unique modulatory effects on corticothalamic connections between the drug classes, adds depth to the discussion of how pharmacological profiles could dictate variations in experience and therapeutic potential. \n\n### Limitations Noted\nWhile the study offers innovative insights, its novelty could be constrained by factors such as sample size and anatomical or functional specifics related to the chosen animal model. Future studies could benefit from larger cohorts and examination of these mechanisms in various models to validate the findings further.\n\n### Conclusion\nOverall, the study presents several novel contributions to the understanding of hallucinogens, particularly through its comparative methodology and focus on functional connectivity in nonhuman primates. This innovative approach not only enriches current literature but also sets a foundation for future research aimed at elucidating the complex interactions between different hallucinogens and their neurobiological underpinnings."

Potential Confounding Variables:\n- **Control for Confounders**: The authors mentioned that the variable dosages of psilocybin and salvinorin-A were not included as covariates due to sample size considerations. This limitation raises concerns regarding the interpretation of the findings. Future studies should consider exploring robust methods to account for such variables, such as mixed-effects models or ANCOVA, where applicable.\n  \n#### 6. Limitations in Statistical Interpretation:\n- **Interpretation of Statistical Results**: Ensure that the interpretations of statistical results are commensurate with the statistical significance levels. For example, discussions around effect sizes or the nature of connectivity changes should reflect this accurately, especially if the results hover around the significance threshold.\n\n#### Recommendations for Future Research:\n- Consider exploring additional statistical methodologies, such as machine learning approaches, which could provide increased sensitivity in detecting FC changes given the neuroimaging context.\n- Further studies should conduct exploratory analyses on taken doses and physiological responses (already monitored) to enhance interpretation robustness.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statistical framework laid out provides a starting foundation for exploring changes in functional connectivity based on the two hallucinogens\u2019 effects. However, incorporating the suggestions above would significantly enhance the rigor and clarity of the analysis. This will facilitate reproducibility and interpretive power for future research in the field."

                "review": "### Feedback on Limitations and Generalizability\n\n#### Limitations\n1. **Sample Size**: The study utilized only three male rhesus macaques, which significantly impacts the statistical power and robustness of the findings. A larger sample would enhance the reliability of the results and allow for more comprehensive statistical analyses that could better account for individual variability.\n\n2. **Variable Dosages**: The differences in dosages administered for psilocybin and salvinorin-A were not incorporated as covariates due to sample size constraints. This could lead to difficulty in discerning the specific effects of dosage on functional connectivity changes, introducing potential confounding variables.\n\n3. **Ventilation Requirement**: Ventilation for the salvinorin-A group due to safety concerns presents difficulties in comparing pre- and post-drug states directly. The effects of controlled ventilation on the fMRI signals may introduce additional variability and complicate interpretation.\n\n4. **Timing Between Drug Challenges**: Lack of control over the timing of drug challenges complicates comparisons between the two substances. Variability in the resting time could influence the functional connectivity measurements, potentially confounding the results.\n\n5. **Generalizability of Animal Model**: While the study underscores the significance of hallucinogens within a nonhuman primate model, it is worth noting that findings derived from rhesus macaques may not directly translate to human populations due to inherent physiological and neurological differences. \n\n#### Generalizability\n1. **Species-Specific Differences**: The physiological and anatomical differences between rhesus macaques and humans could limit the applicability of findings to human populations. While there are parallels, the nuances in the neurobiology of hallucinogens might differ significantly between species.\n\n2. **Cultural and Contextual Factors**: The behavioral and psychological manifestations of hallucinogens in humans are influenced by cultural and social contexts, factors that are absent in this nonhuman primate study. Future research should consider these aspects to enhance the generalizability of results to human experiences.\n\n3. **Limited Drug Class Representation**: The study compares only one serotonergic and one non-serotonergic hallucinogen. This narrow focus may not capture the full spectrum of effects that other hallucinogens with varying pharmacological profiles could exert on functional connectivity in both nonhuman and human subjects.\n\n4. **Clinical Implications**: While the findings provide insights into functional connectivity and suggest potential therapeutic implications, the translation of these results to clinical settings requires cautious interpretation. Clinical studies involving diverse populations of human subjects will be essential to assess the therapeutic viability of insights gained from this animal model.\n\nIn summary, while the study offers valuable insights into the effects of psilocybin and salvinorin-A on functional connectivity, the limitations regarding sample size, variable dosages, and the choice of animal model must be carefully considered when interpreting the findings and assessing their generalizability to human populations. Future studies should strive for a larger, more representative sample and account for the contextual factors that could affect hallucinogen responses in humans."

                "review": "### Review of Ethical Concerns in the Paper: \"Acute Effects of Hallucinogens on Functional Connectivity: Psilocybin and Salvinorin-A\"\n\n1. **Use of Nonhuman Primates (NHPs)**:\n   - The study employs rhesus macaques, which raises significant ethical considerations. Research involving NHPs must adhere to strict ethical guidelines due to their complex cognitive and emotional capabilities. The authors mention compliance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) regulations, but it would bolster the ethical justification to provide clearer details regarding the ethical review process and any assessments undertaken to minimize animal distress and ensure adequate housing and enrichment.\n\n2. **Informed Consent**:\n   - While informed consent is not applicable to NHPs as it is with human subjects, it\u2019s crucial to demonstrate that the welfare of the animals was prioritized. The paper should explain how consent was effectively represented through compliance with ethical standards and how the potential benefits of the findings justify the use of animal models.\n\n3. **Minimization of Harm**:\n   - The administration of hallucinogens like Psilocybin and Salvinorin-A poses risks, including potential discomfort, psychological distress, or adverse physiological responses. Although the authors mention that heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration were monitored constantly, it would be beneficial to detail specific criteria for assessing and mitigating potential harm to the animals. A more thorough risk assessment approach would strengthen the ethical implications of the methodology used.\n\n4. **Veterinary Supervision**:\n   - The study indicates that a qualified veterinarian supervised the NHPs during the experiments. However, it would enhance ethical transparency to elaborate on the criteria for veterinary intervention and outlines of emergency procedures in the case of adverse reactions. This can reassure that all measures were taken to safeguard the animals' well-being throughout the study.\n\n5. **Animal Recovery**:\n   - The authors state that all NHPs recovered successfully after the experiments. Providing more detailed follow-up care protocols and the duration of post-experimental monitoring would strengthen the ethical considerations regarding animal welfare. This is particularly significant given the complexities associated with administering psychoactive compounds.\n\n6. **Scientific Value vs. Ethical Cost**:\n   - The implications of the findings should be critically examined within the context of their scientific value versus the ethical costs incurred by using animal subjects. A discussion on alternative methods that could yield comparable insights without animal use, such as human trials with stringent ethical guidelines, could be included to address the broader implications of animal experimentation.\n\n7. **Potential for Broader Impact**:\n   - As the study discusses hallucinogens in a therapeutic context, it is important to reflect on and report any potential societal implications of the findings regarding drug use and addiction. A consideration of how this research fits into larger conversations about the ethics of drug use, addiction, and treatment standards would provide a more comprehensive view of the ethical landscape.\n\nIn summary, while the study has scientific merit, the ethical considerations surrounding animal research must be thoroughly addressed to align with contemporary ethical standards in biomedical research. Enhanced details regarding animal welfare, harm minimization, and the ethical justification for the use of NHPs would benefit the overall ethical framework of the study."

                "review": "### Feedback on Methodology\n\nThe methodology section of the paper detailing the \"Acute Effects of Hallucinogens on Functional Connectivity: Psilocybin and Salvinorin\u2011A\" offers a substantial framework for exploring the functional connectivity changes induced by hallucinogens in nonhuman primates. Here are some points of feedback and suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. **Sample Size**: The study involves only three male rhesus macaques. While the within-subject design helps mitigate individual variability, the small sample size raises concerns about the statistical power and generalizability of the findings. Future studies should consider a larger cohort to strengthen the results and allow for more robust statistical analyses.\n\n2. **Dosing Regimen**: The differing doses for Psilocybin and Salvinorin-A due to pre-existing studies may introduce variability that could affect the study's outcomes. It would be beneficial to integrate a more controlled dosing strategy or limit comparisons to a specific dose group for each substance to ensure consistency.\n\n3. **Monitoring Physiological Parameters**: The monitoring of heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration is appropriately mentioned, which is critical for safety during anesthetization and drug administration. Moreover, providing more detail on the specific ranges deemed \"normal\" and any procedural responses to deviations could enhance the methodological rigor.\n\n4. **Ventilation Control**: Implementing ventilation for the Salvinorin-A group is a prudent safety measure, particularly given the drug's potential effects on breathing. However, the influence of ventilation on the functional signals and its potential to introduce confounding variables need more explicit discussion. The authors should clarify how ventilation could influence fMRI results and consider exploring alternative safety measures that do not affect the signal.\n\n5. **fMRI Acquisition and Preprocessing**: The preprocessing pipeline is well described, utilizing appropriate techniques like motion correction and nuisance regression. However, it would be beneficial to provide more justification for the specific parameters chosen (e.g., band-pass filter settings) and how they align with current standards in the field. Additionally, the rationale for choosing 0.005 to 0.1 Hz specifically should be clearer, explaining why these frequency bands are relevant in the context of hallucinogen research.\n\n6. **Neuroimaging Analysis Techniques**: The usage of seed-based correlation analysis is suitable for exploring functional connectivity. Nonetheless, it might also be useful to complement these findings with other techniques such as independent component analysis (ICA) or graph-theoretical approaches, which could provide more insights into the functional network dynamics following drug administration.\n\n7. **Statistical Analysis**: While the paired t-test with Bonferroni correction is a solid choice for handling multiple comparisons, elaborating on the reasoning behind this method would enhance the rigor of the statistical approach. Furthermore, including information about effect sizes or confidence intervals would provide more context regarding the significance and magnitude of the observed changes.\n\n8. **Limitations Acknowledgment**: The acknowledgment of methodological limitations, particularly regarding variability in drug dosing and the potential confounds introduced by the anesthesia and ventilation, is noted. However, recommendations for addressing these issues in future studies should be more explicit to guide subsequent work.\n\nOverall, the methodology is robust and lays a solid foundation for the study. Addressing the points mentioned can help clarify the findings and bolster the study's contribution to understanding the neurophysiological effects of hallucinogens."
