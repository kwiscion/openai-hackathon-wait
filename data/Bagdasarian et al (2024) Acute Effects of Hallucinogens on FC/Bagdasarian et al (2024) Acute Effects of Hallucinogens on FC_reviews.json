                "review": "### Feedback on Statistical Analysis and Reporting\n\n1. **Statistical Methods Description**:\n   - The statistical methodology used in the study should ideally be described in more detail. While the authors mention using paired t-tests to assess pre- and post-drug \\(Z\\)-scores with corrections for multiple comparisons, further explanation of the specific method of correction (e.g., Bonferroni, FDR) is needed to evaluate the robustness of the statistical findings.\n   - Indicating the software or tools utilized for the statistical analyses would enhance the reproducibility of the study.\n\n2. **Sample Size Justification**:\n   - The authors mention pooling data across different doses for a total \\(N = 7\\) per drug group but do not provide justification for the sample size selection. Including a power analysis to determine the adequacy of the sample size for detecting meaningful effects would strengthen the reliability of the results.\n\n3. **Exploratory vs. Confirmatory Analysis**:\n   - It's unclear whether the statistical analysis is primarily exploratory or confirmatory. This distinction is crucial, especially in neuroscientific studies where multiple comparisons can inflate the risk of Type I errors. Clarifying this aspect may guide readers on interpreting the statistical significance of the findings.\n\n4. **Reporting of Effect Sizes**:\n   - While statistical significance is reported, effect sizes (e.g., Cohen's \\(d\\) for t-tests) are not mentioned. Including effect sizes would provide a better understanding of the practical significance of the findings and help interpret the clinical relevance of FC changes.\n\n5. **Confidence Intervals**:\n   - The incorporation of confidence intervals (CIs) for the effect estimates could enhance the statistical reporting. CIs provide insight into the precision of the estimates and facilitate a better understanding of the variability within the data.\n\n6. **Data Visualization**:\n   - Figures illustrating the results are referenced but not sufficiently integrated into the statistical discourse within the text. Clearer connections between the statistical findings and their visual representations would improve the reader's comprehension. Including annotations or statistical significance markers directly on the figures could reinforce the points being made.\n\n7. **Limitations Addressed in Context**:\n   - The discussion of limitations related to the statistical analysis (e.g., confounding factors due to ventilation or varying drug dosages) is critical. Nevertheless, it would be beneficial to acknowledge how these limitations might have impacted the statistical outcomes and interpretations explicitly in the results section.\n\n8. **Clarity on Multiple Comparisons**:\n   - The authors mention utilizing corrections for multiple comparisons but do not address how this may affect the interpretation of specific findings. A discussion on which specific measures were considered significant after correction would help clarify which effects should be taken forward into further analysis or discussion.\n\n### Overall Impression\nThe statistical analysis and reporting in this paper could be strengthened with more detailed explanations of methods, justifications for sample sizes, and inclusion of effect sizes or confidence intervals. Additionally, clearer connections between quantitative results and visual representations would enhance the overall comprehensibility and rigor of the statistical arguments made."

                "review": "## Feedback on Ethical Concerns\n\n### Ethical Concerns Overview\n\nThe paper presents research involving nonhuman primates (NHPs), specifically rhesus macaques, exploring the acute effects of hallucinogens (psilocybin and salvinorin-A) on functional connectivity in the brain. While the study has scientific merit, several ethical considerations must be addressed:\n\n### 1. Justification of Animal Use\n- **Ethical Oversight:** The research cites approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), which is crucial for ensuring compliance with ethical standards. However, further details about how the justification for using NHPs was articulated would strengthen the ethical stance. Why were alternatives (e.g., in vitro studies or computer modeling) not employed? The necessity of using NHPs should be clearly justified given their higher cognitive abilities and the ethical implications therein.\n\n### 2. Welfare of the Animals\n- **Monitoring and Recovery:** The paper states that the animals' physiological parameters (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, respiration rate) were monitored during the experiments. While this suggests attention to animal welfare, additional information about the recovery protocols after drug administration is needed. How were the animals ensured to be free from adverse effects post-experiment? Were any negative effects, either short-term or long-term, observed, documented, or mitigated?\n\n### 3. Drug Administration and Dosage\n- **Dosage and Effects:** The administration of hallucinogens raises ethical questions about potential pain, suffering, or distress. The paper specifies differing dosage regimes for the drugs used. Transparency about how these dosages were determined and the potential effects of these substances on the animals' well-being is essential. Were specific measures taken to minimize discomfort or adverse effects associated with the substances administered?\n\n### 4. Long-Term Impact and Post-Experimental Handling\n- **Long-Term Consequences:** The study does not address the potential long-term psychological or physiological effects of hallucinogen exposure on NHPs. Consideration of whether follow-up observations or assessments will be conducted post-experiment is necessary. Ethical protocols should include a plan for the care and monitoring of the NHPs beyond the experimental period to ensure their well-being.\n\n### 5. Communication of Findings\n- **Transparency and Public Understanding:** Given the ongoing societal debates surrounding the use of psychedelics, there is a responsibility to communicate findings transparently. Results should be framed in a way that underscores both their scientific value and ethical considerations. How will the findings be disseminated responsibly, especially considering potential misinterpretations or misuse?\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile the research aims to provide valuable insights into hallucinogenic substances, it is imperative that the ethical implications of using NHPs are thoroughly considered and transparently reported. Addressing these concerns will enhance the ethical robustness of the study and contribute to responsible scientific inquiry in this sensitive area of research."

                "review": "### Methodology Feedback\n\nThe methodology section of the paper titled \"Acute Effects of Hallucinogens on Functional Connectivity: Psilocybin and Salvinorin\u2011A\" is generally well-structured and provides a comprehensive outline of the experimental design. However, there are several areas for improvement and clarification:\n\n1. **Sample Size and Randomization**:\n   - The study includes three male rhesus macaques, which raises concerns regarding the sample size. Given that this is a neuroscience study aiming to discern functional connectivity changes between two hallucinogens, a larger sample size is generally preferable to enhance statistical power and robustness of the results. \n   - The authors mention that drug application is pseudorandomized but do not provide details on how randomization was implemented. Further clarification on randomization protocols would strengthen the methodology's rigor.\n\n2. **Drug Administration**:\n   - The varying dosages of psilocybin and salvinorin-A could introduce confounding factors. The authors do not account for the potential impact of different dosage regimens on functional connectivity (FC) outcomes. A more systematic approach to dosing, perhaps controlling for dosage or including equal dose groups, could mitigate these concerns.\n   - It would be beneficial to include the rationale for selecting the specific dosages used for each substance. This contextual information would help readers understand the pharmacological basis for the chosen amounts.\n\n3. **Anesthesia Protocol**:\n   - Maintenance of anesthesia with isoflurane is noted, but the potential effects of anesthesia on FC should be discussed in more detail. Anesthesia can profoundly alter brain activity, and its impact on the interpretation of results related to hallucinogen effects should be more explicitly addressed.\n\n4. **Monitoring and Physiological Variables**:\n   - While the physiological parameters monitored (heart rate, blood pressure, etc.) are mentioned, it would be helpful to elaborate on how these variables were controlled, monitored, and integrated into the analysis of FC changes. Were any physiological parameters specifically correlated with changes in FC?\n   - The authors state that there were three instances of resting times less than 50 days, which could affect recovery from previous drug challenges. More discussion on how resting times were managed and any potential implications for serial imaging would provide additional transparency.\n\n5. **Functional Connectivity Analysis**:\n   - The pipeline for fMRI preprocessing and FC analysis is detailed but could benefit from a flowchart or diagram illustrating the sequence of steps for clearer comprehension.\n   - The use of blind or fully automated methods for the identification of regions of interest (ROI) and subsequent analysis could increase reproducibility and reliability of the outcomes.\n\n6. **Statistical Considerations**:\n   - While the analysis mentions paired t-tests for significance assessment, additional details regarding the statistical corrections applied for multiple comparisons could strengthen the methodological rigor. Type I error rates can be a concern in studies with multiple hypotheses, and the authors should ensure appropriate controls are highlighted.\n\nIn conclusion, while the methodology follows a systematic and logical structure, addressing the concerns listed above would enhance clarity and robustness, enabling a stronger foundation for interpreting the findings. Improved sample size, detailed randomization protocols, and careful consideration of dosage and physiological factors will help solidify the study's contributions to our understanding of hallucinogens and their effects on functional connectivity."
