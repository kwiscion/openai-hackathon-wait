    "synthesized_strengths": "The manuscript presents novel insights into the effects of psilocybin and salvinorin-A on brain functional connectivity, offering valuable contributions to our understanding of hallucinogens' impact on brain networks. It notably addresses the claustrum's role in consciousness and highlights both common and distinct modulation effects by these substances.",
    "synthesized_weaknesses": "There is consensus on concerns regarding the small sample size of three rhesus macaques, which limits the generalizability of the findings. Methodologically, the study could benefit from incorporating additional connectivity analysis methods and providing more detailed statistical corrections. A lack of temporal analysis and a clearer linkage between neuropharmacological mechanisms and subjective experiences were also identified as areas needing improvement.",
    "overall_assessment": "The paper is engaging and offers meaningful contributions to the field through its unique focus on functional connectivity. However, its impact is tempered by methodological limitations and a small sample size, which constrain its broader applicability. Addressing these methodological and analytical gaps, clarifying ethical protocols, and expanding on the discussion of potential implications across species would enhance the paper significantly.",
    "editorial_recommendation": "Minor Revision",
    "confidence_assessment": "The reviewer is confident in their assessment, highlighting a strong understanding of the methodological and ethical considerations inherent in this type of research.",
    "ethical_concerns": "Ethical concerns are present due to the use of nonhuman primates in hallucinogen research, with particular focus on animal welfare, ethical justification for using such subjects, monitoring procedures, and potential psychological impacts on the animals.",
