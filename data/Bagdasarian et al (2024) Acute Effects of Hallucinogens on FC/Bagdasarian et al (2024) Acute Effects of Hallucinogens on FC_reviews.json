                "review": "### Feedback on Functional Connectivity Analysis\n\nThe functional connectivity (FC) analysis presented in your study on the acute effects of psilocybin and salvinorin-A offers intriguing insights into the neural mechanisms underlying hallucinogenic effects. The choice of seed regions (claustrum, thalamus, PFC, DMN subcomponents) is well-justified and aligns with existing literature. However, a few crucial aspects warrant further consideration:\n\n1. **Methodological Rigor:**\n   - While the seed-based analysis approach is straightforward, it would benefit from a more comprehensive exploration of connectivity patterns using multiple analysis methods. Consider including independent component analysis (ICA) or graph theory approaches to capture the dynamics of functional networks more fully. This could reveal subtle alterations in connectivity that seed-based methods might miss, especially given the complex pharmacological profiles of psilocybin and salvinorin-A.\n\n2. **Statistical Considerations:**\n   - It is commendable that you have applied corrections for multiple comparisons. However, providing details on the extent of correction (e.g., Bonferroni vs. Benjamini-Hochberg) would strengthen the reliability of your findings. Moreover, consider performing a robustness check on the findings using bootstrapping methods or cross-validation, which could further substantiate your claims regarding the significant changes observed.\n\n3. **Temporal Dynamics:**\n   - The analysis focuses on post-drug effects but lacks an exploration of the temporal dynamics of FC changes. Implementing a sliding window approach could help elucidate how connectivity evolves over time relative to the onset of drug effects. Understanding these temporal relationships may provide deeper insights into the mechanisms by which different hallucinogens exert their effects.\n\n4. **Interpretation of DMN Connectivity:**\n   - The reported dissociations in DMN connectivity are noteworthy. However, further discussion on how these changes could relate to subjective experiences of consciousness would enhance the analysis. Integrating qualitative data or direct measures of subjective experience (e.g., questionnaires assessing altered states of consciousness) could bolster the connection between FC changes and cognitive or perceptual changes experienced by subjects.\n\n5. **Limitations of Sample Size:**\n   - The study comprises only three male rhesus macaques, which is a small sample size. While within-subject comparisons mitigate some effects of individual variability, the findings should be approached with caution. Discussing the implications of the small sample size on generalizability while suggesting future studies with larger cohorts would strengthen the methodological transparency of your work.\n\n6. **Discussion on Claustral Connectivity:**\n   - The emphasis on the claustrum's role as a major hub for hallucinogenic activity is compelling. However, additional exploration of its connectivity beyond the frontal regions is warranted. Investigating how the claustrum interacts with other brain regions, especially those implicated in sensory integration and self-awareness, could provide a more robust picture of its functional significance.\n\n### Conclusion\nOverall, the functional connectivity analysis in this paper is a strong contribution to the understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of hallucinogens. Addressing the points outlined could enhance the robustness of your findings and their interpretation, ultimately leading to more impactful conclusions regarding the effects of psilocybin and salvinorin-A on brain connectivity."

                "review": "### Feedback on the Comparison of Hallucinogenic Effects\n\nThe paper titled \"Acute Effects of Hallucinogens on Functional Connectivity: Psilocybin and Salvinorin-A\" presents a compelling investigation into the differences and similarities between the functional connectivity effects of two distinct hallucinogens with differing pharmacological profiles. Here are key points of feedback concerning the comparison of their hallucinogenic effects:\n\n1. **Comparative Framework**:\n   - The study successfully highlights both overlapping and unique impacts of psilocybin and salvinorin-A on functional connectivity (FC). For example, the findings concerning increased FC in the claustrum-cortex network for both substances and unique FC changes for salvinorin-A in angular gyrus connections lend strong support to the research questions posed. However, a clearer framework for why these substances exhibit both similar and divergent neural pathways could enrich the discussion. For instance, deeper insights into the underlying neurochemical mechanisms (beyond 5-HT2AR and KOR interactions) that may guide the observed effects could provide context for their differing subjective experiences.\n\n2. **Subjective Experience Correlation**:\n   - While the study discusses the neurophysiological effects on FC, it could greatly benefit from a more explicit connection between these changes in connectivity and the subjective experiences reported by users of each hallucinogen. For example, how the increased or decreased connectivity aligns with the clinical effects or psychoactive experiences reported in literature, especially in cases with significant differences in user experience (e.g., the euphoria of psilocybin vs. the dysphoria of salvinorin-A), should be elaborated. Specifying the implications that observational data may have on psychological outcomes or symptomatology may further substantiate the relevance of these findings.\n\n3. **Methodological Rigor**:\n   - The methodological elements regarding the animal model (rhesus monkeys) used are robust, given their translational relevance to human subjects. That being said, more information on the variability in dosages and how that might affect interpretations could improve understanding of any inconsistencies in results due to pharmacological factors. Additionally, considering the limitations regarding the sample size and drug administration timing, comparisons should account for statistical power and whether the timing between doses could introduce confounding variables.\n\n4. **Multimodal Integration**:\n   - A suggestion for future research is to incorporate multimodal imaging techniques, such as EEG alongside fMRI, to capture both the temporal and spatial dynamics of hallucinogen-induced changes in brain connectivity. Integrating data could offer a more holistic view of the neurophysiological effects of these substances.\n\n5. **Broader Implications**:\n   - The paper could enhance discussions around potential therapeutic implications of these findings. The pathways highlighted might have clinical relevance, not just for understanding psychoactive effects but also for future clinical applications involving psilocybin and salvinorin-A in treating psychiatric disorders. Exploration of potential treatments that could emerge from these findings (especially from novel insights into neurotechnology) could be included in the concluding remarks.\n\nIn summary, this study provides important insights into the comparative hallucinogenic effects of psilocybin and salvinorin-A, revealing both overlapping and unique neural pathways. A more holistic approach, connecting these findings to subjective experiences, enhancing methodological rigor, and discussing broader implications for clinical applications could elevate the research impact."
