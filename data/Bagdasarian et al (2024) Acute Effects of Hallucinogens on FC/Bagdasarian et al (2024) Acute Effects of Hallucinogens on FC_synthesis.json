    "synthesized_strengths": "The manuscript excels with its innovative within-subject design comparing psilocybin and salvinorin-A effects on functional connectivity in rhesus macaques, minimizing variability and enhancing result reliability. It provides a comprehensive analysis using seed-based fMRI, particularly in relation to the Default Mode Network and cortico-claustro-cortical networks, contributing meaningfully to theoretical psychopharmacological discussions. The depiction of results with diagrams and figures aids in conveying complex concepts effectively, adding clarity to the presentation.",
    "synthesized_weaknesses": "A significant limitation is the small sample size of three macaques, impacting generalizability. Methodological transparency, particularly in data preprocessing and statistical techniques, requires improvement for reproducibility. Confounding factors, such as variations in dosing and the effects of anesthesia, need clearer acknowledgment. Moreover, the interpretation of results would benefit from stronger ties to existing literature and theoretical frameworks. Finally, ethical execution should be more robustly articulated, with better explanations of procedures in place for animal welfare.",
    "overall_assessment": "While the study provides valuable insights into the distinct and overlapping effects of psilocybin and salvinorin-A on brain connectivity, it faces challenges with the small sample size and methodological transparency. It effectively advances theoretical discussions, yet it needs a clearer exploration of ethical considerations and contextual robustness. Enhancements in methodological explanations and ethical disclosures would strengthen the manuscript considerably, fostering a deeper interpretation of findings.",
    "editorial_recommendation": "Major Revision",
    "confidence_assessment": "There is a high level of confidence in the reviews, with consistent strengths and weaknesses identified across all evaluations.",
    "ethical_concerns": "Ethical concerns mainly focus on the welfare of nonhuman primates, underscoring the need for detailed ethical protocols. The reviewers emphasize a need for transparency in animal care, handling, and the ethical justification for using these models, as well as in addressing potential long-term effects on the animals.",
