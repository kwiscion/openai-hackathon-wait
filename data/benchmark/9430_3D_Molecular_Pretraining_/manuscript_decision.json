    "rationale": "The manuscript proposes an original and chemically motivated pre-training paradigm that tokenises 3-D molecules into one-hop tetrahedral fragments and reconstructs them with a two-stage geometric objective inside an edge-explicit TokenGT backbone.  Reviewers agree that this represents a meaningful conceptual advance over atom-wise masking and that empirical results show clear gains over a strong baseline.  However, there are multiple substantive shortcomings that prevent publication in its present form.  Most importantly, (i) the tetrahedral abstraction is not demonstrably adequate across the diversity of chemical coordination environments; (ii) the corruption scheme (simple isotropic Gaussian noise) and reconstruction losses ignore basic chemical validity constraints (valence, bond order, ring closure), risking learning from or producing unphysical structures; (iii) several major empirical claims\u2014improved equivariance, functional-semantic fidelity, competitive SOTA performance\u2014are insufficiently validated: evaluation is limited to MoleculeNet (largely 2-D) and PCQM4Mv2, and comparisons to the latest SE(3)-equivariant or diffusion-based methods are missing; (iv) theoretical justification of symmetry properties and computational overhead analysis are absent; (v) reporting of segmentation details, hyper-parameters and ablations is incomplete; and (vi) interpretability benefits are asserted but not demonstrated.  These issues are substantial yet appear addressable within a major-revision cycle.  Hence the recommendation is Major Revisions.",
    "key_strengths": "1. Novel idea of using one-hop tetrahedral fragments as tokens provides an intuitive chemistry-aware inductive bias.\n2. Clean two-stage reconstruction objective that separates global orientation from internal geometry.\n3. Edge-explicit adaptation of TokenGT mitigates atom\u2013bond inconsistency and is well implemented.\n4. Empirical improvements over baseline TokenGT on MoleculeNet and PCQM4Mv2; ablations on mask ratio and noise scale supplied.\n5. Code appears reproducible and reasonably documented; no ethical or data-usage concerns.",
    "key_weaknesses": "1. Chemical coverage: planar, hypervalent, or atypical local environments are poorly handled; authors overstate universality of tetrahedra.\n2. Corruption/reconstruction ignores chemical validity constraints, encouraging unphysical geometries.\n3. Equivariance and symmetry claims are neither theoretically proven nor empirically tested.\n4. Evaluation scope narrow; lacks multi-conformer tasks, real 3-D benchmarks, and comparisons to current SOTA (e.g., SE(3) diffusion, equivariant transformers).\n5. Missing ablations (edge-explicit vs implicit, alternative segmentation units) and incomplete hyper-parameter reporting.\n6. Interpretability claims unsubstantiated.\n7. Computational cost and scalability not analysed.",
    "specific_revisions": "1. Provide a rigorous analysis of how the tetrahedral unit covers diverse coordination motifs: quantify percentage of atoms in common datasets that fit the assumption; discuss failure cases and possible extensions.\n2. Replace or augment isotropic Gaussian noise with a chemically plausible perturbation (e.g., distance-aware or torsion-based) and incorporate valence/bond-order constraints into the edge-prediction loss; report chemical validity metrics of reconstructed structures.\n3. Theoretically characterise the model\u2019s SE(3) behaviour and/or empirically measure equivariance error.\n4. Extend benchmarking to: (a) QM9, MD-17 or ANI-1x for 3-D geometry tasks; (b) multi-conformer datasets (e.g., GEOM-QM9) to test robustness; (c) compare against recent equivariant/diffusion models (Uni-Mol-V2, EDM, MolDiff, SE(3)-Diff), using identical data splits and metrics.\n5. Add ablations: (i) edge-explicit vs edge-implicit TokenGT; (ii) alternative segmentation (e.g., rings, functional groups); (iii) different noise schedules.\n6. Provide full training details: learning-rate schedule, data augmentation, segmentation algorithm pseudo-code, runtime and memory footprint.\n7. Demonstrate interpretability: qualitative visualisation of learned tetrahedral embeddings or attention maps correlated with functional groups.\n8. Discuss computational complexity vs baselines and provide wall-clock times.\n9. Minor: clarify notation inconsistencies, fix typos, and ensure figures are readable in print.",
