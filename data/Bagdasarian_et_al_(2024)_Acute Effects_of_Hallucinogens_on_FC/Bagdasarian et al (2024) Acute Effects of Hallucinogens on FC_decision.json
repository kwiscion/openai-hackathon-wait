    "decision": "major revisions",
    "rationale": "The manuscript presents significant advancements in psychedelic research by comparing the effects of psilocybin and salvinorin-A on functional connectivity in nonhuman primates, filling an important gap in the literature. However, several critical weaknesses need addressing. The limited sample size of three subjects raises concerns about the generalizability and statistical power of the findings. Additionally, variability in dosing regimens complicates comparisons between the two substances, and anesthetic effects from isoflurane must be better accounted for. Furthermore, the manuscript lacks a thorough exploration of behavioral correlates related to the neuroimaging findings, which limits its clinical applicability. Ethical considerations regarding animal welfare require a more comprehensive discussion.",
    "key_strengths": "1. Novel comparison of psilocybin and salvinorin-A impacts on functional connectivity, addressing a significant gap in psychedelic research.\n2. Utilizes advanced fMRI techniques and a within-subject design, enhancing the reliability of the findings.\n3. Focuses on important brain regions relevant to understanding hallucinogenic effects, laying groundwork for future therapeutic applications.",
    "key_weaknesses": "1. Limited sample size (three nonhuman primates) diminishes statistical power and generalizability of results.\n2. Variability in drug dosing complicates direct comparisons of the substances' effects.\n3. Confounding effects of isoflurane anesthesia and its potential impact on imaging outcomes must be more explicitly addressed.\n4. Insufficient exploration of behavioral correlates limits the clinical relevance of neuroimaging findings.",
    "specific_revisions": "1. Increase sample size and clarify dosing regimens for better comparability.\n2. Provide additional data or analyses on behavioral correlates related to neuroimaging findings.\n3. Discuss the potential confounding effects of anesthesia in more depth and consider alternative methodological approaches to mitigate these issues.",
    "priority_issues": [
        "Address the limited sample size and increase statistical power.",
        "Clarify the dosing regimens used in the study.",
        "Include a detailed discussion of anesthesia effects on imaging results."
    ],
    "ethical_considerations": "There are ethical concerns related to the use of nonhuman primates in the research. A more robust discussion is required to justify the use of these models, the distress caused by hallucinogen administration, and adherence to ethical standards."
