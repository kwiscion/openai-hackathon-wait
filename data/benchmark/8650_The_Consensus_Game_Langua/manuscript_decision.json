    "decision": "major revisions",
    "rationale": "The manuscript offers a well-motivated and technically elegant contribution\u2014casting decoding as a KL-regularised signalling game and implementing an efficient no-regret equilibrium search that consistently improves accuracy without any model fine-tuning.  Reviewers agree that the core idea is original, theoretically well-grounded, and practically appealing.  Nonetheless, several substantive weaknesses prevent publication in its current form.  Chief among them are (i) insufficient evidence that the approach scales beyond small, manually enumerated candidate sets; (ii) incomplete and, in places, un-controlled empirical comparisons (missing or unevenly tuned baselines, lack of variance or significance reporting, and little hyper-parameter sensitivity analysis); (iii) limited discussion or experimentation regarding safety, bias propagation, and potential dataset contamination; and (iv) gaps in transparency and reproducibility (prompts, code, evaluation scripts).  These issues are material and require additional experiments, analyses, and clarifications that go beyond minor polishing but are feasible within a single revision cycle.  Therefore, a decision of Major Revisions is appropriate.",
    "key_strengths": "1. Conceptual novelty: reframing LM decoding as a regularised signalling game is fresh and connects NLP decoding to mature game-theoretic tools.\n2. Practical utility: method is training-free, light-weight, and can be layered atop existing LMs; empirical wins sometimes let a 7B model match/outperform 65B\u2013540B baselines.\n3. Theoretical clarity: equilibrium formulation and convergence guarantees are clearly derived and situate the work within no-regret learning literature.\n4. Versatility: demonstrated gains across six diverse QA benchmarks; approach is potentially complementary to deliberative methods (e.g., CoT, self-consistency).",
    "key_weaknesses": "1. Scalability: current experiments restrict |Y| to \u22644 (MC) or \u226420 (sampled); no evidence the algorithm remains tractable or effective for open-vocabulary generation.\n2. Empirical rigor: many tables lack variance/error bars; no statistical significance tests; hyper-parameters (\u03bb,\u03b7) are fixed without robustness study; some baselines (e.g., contrastive decoding, rerankers using external models) are absent or under-tuned.\n3. Safety & bias: generator and discriminator share the same LM and may reinforce biases or hallucinations; no quantitative bias/toxicity or robustness analysis is provided.\n4. Reproducibility & transparency: prompts, sampling seeds, full evaluation scripts, and code are not released; details needed to replicate results (e.g., normalization constants, inference hardware) are partial.\n5. Ethical discussion: potential dataset contamination and foreseeable misuse are only briefly mentioned; no concrete mitigation strategies.\n6. Minor clarity issues: a few typos, overloaded notation, and missing references in Appendix.",
    "specific_revisions": "1. Scalability & Complexity:\n   a. Provide either (i) empirical results on a task with \u2265100 generated candidates (e.g., beam or nucleus at p=0.95) or (ii) a detailed complexity analysis plus heuristic pruning strategy with ablation.\n2. Experimental Rigor:\n   a. Add variance across \u22653 random seeds and report statistical significance (e.g., paired bootstrap) for all main tables.\n   b. Conduct hyper-parameter sensitivity sweeps for \u03bb and \u03b7 and discuss default-setting robustness.\n   c. Include strong state-of-the-art reranking controls (contrastive decoding, verifier-trained reranker, or external critic model) with matched prompt and tuning.\n3. Safety, Bias & Alignment:\n   a. Quantitatively evaluate bias/toxicity amplification (e.g., BOLD, RealToxicityPrompts) and factuality/hallucination (e.g., FaithDial, Concise Factuality) comparing generator vs. equilibrium outputs.\n   b. Discuss mitigation strategies if reinforcement of bias is observed; clarify whether using a different LM for the discriminator changes outcomes (provide small experiment).\n4. Reproducibility & Transparency:\n   a. Release or include in supplementary material all prompts, candidate-generation code, ranking scripts, and hyper-parameter grids; specify hardware and compute cost.\n   b. Provide detailed dataset licence statements and an explicit check for possible train\u2013test contamination.\n5. Presentation:\n   a. Fix noted typographical errors and unify notation (e.g., \u03c0_G vs. \u03c0_\ud835\udd3e).\n   b. Shorten some dense derivations or move to appendix; ensure all figures and tables are referenced in text.",

    "ethical_considerations": "The main concern is potential reinforcement of the generator\u2019s biases/hallucinations because both players share parameters.  The manuscript must add quantitative bias/toxicity evaluation, clarify dataset provenance and contamination risks, and discuss mitigation or alternative discriminator instantiations.  No human subjects or sensitive data issues are identified beyond these points, but transparency on model usage licences and benchmark terms should be added for completeness.  Completion of the above will satisfy the journal\u2019s ethical policy requirements for responsible AI research dissemination."
