Unique Focus on Non-Serotonergic and Serotonergic Hallucinogens:**\nThe study's novelty lies primarily in its comparative approach. By contrasting a classical serotonergic hallucinogen (psilocybin) with a non-serotonergic hallucinogen (salvinorin-A), the authors address a significant gap in the existing literature. While many studies have addressed the effects of individual hallucinogens, few have undertaken a direct comparison of substances with fundamentally different receptor target profiles. This comparison is crucial in understanding the underlying mechanisms by which hallucinogens produce their effects.\n\n**2. Functional Connectivity Framework:**\nThe analysis of functional connectivity changes across several brain regions, primarily focusing on the claustrum, prefrontal cortex (PFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and angular gyrus, enhances the understanding of how these hallucinogens modulate brain activity. The exploration of the cortico-claustro-cortico (CCC) network provides a new theoretical framework that may help in elucidating how various hallucinogens induce altered states of consciousness.\n\n**3. Contribution to Existing Models:**\nFurthermore, the research extends well-established models of psychedelic action by including a unique drugs-based perspective. The findings suggest a degree of consistency in FC changes despite different pharmacological profiles. This commonality could be pivotal for developing a unified model of hallucinogenic action across various substances, which so far has been predominantly studied in isolation.\n\n**4. Methodological Innovation:**\nUtilizing within-subject comparisons in a well-controlled animal model (NHPs) offers an innovative methodological approach. This design enhances the robustness and reliability of the findings, allowing the authors to control for inter-individual variability that often complicates studies in human populations.\n\n### Suggestions for Further Enhancement\n\n- **Broader Contextualization:** While the novelty of the study is clear, it would benefit from a more robust contextualization within the existing literature. Explicitly comparing findings with previous studies on either substance could help strengthen claims about the uniqueness and implications of the results.\n\n- **Exploration of Mechanisms:** Future work could delve deeper into the mechanistic pathways behind the observed changes in functional connectivity, particularly how these pathways may correlate with subjective experiences induced by the different hallucinogens.\n\n- **Consideration of Dosage Effects:** The differential dosing regimens for psilocybin and salvinorin-A may influence the outcomes; thus, further clarity on the impact of dosage on functional connectivity changes could enhance the study's contributions to the literature. \n\nIn conclusion, the paper presents novel insights into the functional connectivity implications of hallucinogens and sets a strong foundation for future research in this rapidly expanding field."

                "review": "### Feedback on Ethical Concerns\n\nThe paper titled \"Acute Effects of Hallucinogens on Functional Connectivity: Psilocybin and Salvinorin-A\" presents certain ethical considerations, particularly pertaining to the use of nonhuman primates (NHPs) in research involving hallucinogens. Here are key points to consider regarding the ethical dimensions of this study:\n\n1. **Animal Welfare**: The research involves the administration of hallucinogenic substances to rhesus macaques. Ethical treatment of animals in research is paramount, and it's crucial to ensure that all procedures adhere to the highest ethical standards. The authors mention that all study procedures were reviewed and approved by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), which is a positive sign for ethical compliance. However, more detail about the specific measures taken to minimize stress and discomfort during drug administration and imaging processes would be beneficial. \n\n2. **Potential Harm vs. Benefits**: The prospect of using substances like psilocybin and salvinorin-A in treating psychiatric conditions can suggest potential benefits to society. However, the risks associated with administering these compounds to nonhuman primates, especially those potentially experiencing adverse effects (e.g., dysphoria or distress), merit careful consideration. The balance between potential therapeutic insights and the duty of care to the animal subjects must be clearly addressed in the paper.\n\n3. **Informed Consent (Indirect)**: While informed consent is not applicable to animal subjects, it is important for researchers to demonstrate that they have taken into account the well-being of the animals used in experiments. Any communication with stakeholders and the public about the implications and ethical considerations of using NHPs for research into psychoactive substances should reflect transparency and responsibility.\n\n4. **Scope of Use**: The justification for using NHPs, which are close relatives to humans in evolutionary terms, needs to be explicitly articulated. While there are strong arguments for their use in neurobiological research due to the close similarity in brain structure and function, the ethical argument should reflect why alternatives (e.g., advance computational models or non-invasive methods) were not considered.\n\n5. **Broader Implications**: The paper addresses the potential for hallucinogens in clinical settings for psychiatric disorders. However, the researchers should explore the implications of their findings in terms of societal views of hallucinogens and the risks of misunderstanding or misuse in the general public. The involvement of hallucinogens in therapeutic settings brings along not just scientific concerns but also cultural and social implications that should be discussed.\n\n6. **Transparency in Reporting Outcomes**: There should be clarity in the reporting of outcomes related to the use of hallucinogens in the study. If adverse effects were documented in the NHPs, these should be reported alongside any positive findings. Failure to transparently disclose all results can lead to ethical concerns about the integrity and reliability of the research findings.\n\nIn summary, while the paper generally adheres to ethical standards by reporting appropriate IACUC approval, there is room for enhanced discussion on animal welfare, risk-benefit analysis, and broader societal implications within the framework of this research. Addressing these concerns explicitly would strengthen the ethical grounding of the research and provide more comprehensive insights for readers and stakeholders."

Below are some strengths and areas for improvement related to the methodology:\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Animal Model**: The use of nonhuman primates (NHPs) like rhesus macaques is a significant strength, given their neuroanatomical and physiological similarities to humans, which enhances the translational potential of the findings.\n\n2. **Anesthesia Protocol**: The careful selection of anesthesia (xylazine and ketamine) followed by isoflurane during imaging helps maintain physiological stability and reduces stress in the animals, which is crucial for obtaining reliable data.\n\n3. **Functional MRI Protocol**: The detailed description of the fMRI imaging acquisition process, including the use of a 3T Siemens TIM-Trio with a BrainPET insert and the specific parameters used for T1-weighted and EPI sequences, lends credence to the reliability of the imaging data.\n\n4. **Functional Connectivity Analysis**: The methodology for seed-based FC analysis is thorough, detailing the specific seed regions used, the preprocessing steps (motion correction, skull-stripping, smoothing), and statistical analyses (paired t-tests with multiple comparison corrections). \n\n5. **Clear Hypothesis and Rationale**: The study is driven by a clear hypothesis regarding the differential effects of psilocybin and salvinorin-A, with a rationale grounded in existing literature. \n\n### Areas for Improvement:\n1. **Sample Size Limitation**: The use of only three animals, with variable dosing and timing between sessions, limits the statistical power and generalizability of the findings. Consideration of additional animal subjects or batch grouping could enhance robustness.\n\n2. **Dose Variation and Control**: The difference in dosing regimens between psilocybin and salvinorin-A could introduce confounding variables. Greater control or randomization in timing between drug administrations could mitigate potential biases.\n\n3. **Resting Time Between Scans**: The mention of varying resting times between scans raises concerns about potential carry-over effects from one drug to the next and how that might influence the observed FC. A systematic examination of the impact of timing on FC might be warranted, perhaps with additional control groups.\n\n4. **Ventilation Considerations**: The use of ventilation for only the salvinorin-A group due to safety concerns might introduce procedural confounds when making comparisons to the psilocybin group. The authors should discuss how ventilation impacts fMRI signal and the implications for FC measures.\n\n5. **Longitudinal Follow-Up**: Although the acute effects are being studied, incorporating follow-up imaging sessions to assess longer-term effects would provide valuable information on the temporal dynamics of FC changes.\n\n6. **Statistical Power & Comparisons**: As the sample size is small, the statistical analyses performed should be approached with caution, particularly when interpreting the significance of observed differences between drugs. The authors might consider further sensitivity analyses to validate the robustness of their findings.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOverall, the methodological framework for this study is robust with careful consideration for the physiological and ethical implications of working with primates. Addressing the points raised regarding sample size, control measures, and the implications of ventilation could significantly strengthen the study's conclusions and reproducibility."

Here are the key points regarding the novelty of the study:\n\n1. **Comparative Analysis of Different Mechanisms**: This study is notably innovative in that it directly compares the effects of psilocybin (a serotonergic hallucinogen) and salvinorin-A (a kappa-opioid receptor agonist) on functional connectivity in the brain. Previous studies predominantly focused on one type of hallucinogen at a time. By establishing within-subject comparisons, this research offers new insights into the distinct and overlapping neural mechanisms influenced by these substances.\n\n2. **Focus on the Claustrum**: The research highlights the role of the claustrum in hallucinogenic experiences, suggesting it functions as a \"conductor\" of subjective consciousness. While the claustrum has been mentioned in previous research, this paper provides empirical evidence of its connectivity changes in response to acute hallucinogen administration, adding a layer of complexity to our understanding of psychedelic neuroanatomy.\n\n3. **Expansion of Functional Connectivity Literature**: While there is substantial literature on the effects of hallucinogens on networks like the Default Mode Network (DMN), this study goes further by exploring how different hallucinogens affect cortico-claustro-cortico networks and thalamic connectivity. The findings indicate distinctive patterns of alteration between psilocybin and salvinorin-A, which could inform future therapeutic applications and research directions.\n\n4. **Implications for Psychiatric Disorders**: The novelty is further underscored by the implications for understanding hallucinogenic effects in the context of cognitive disorders characterized by hallucinations or altered consciousness states. The authors propose that their findings may help delineate mechanisms of action relevant for therapeutic applications, thus situating their work at the intersection of neuroscience, pharmacology, and psychiatry.\n\n5. **Use of Nonhuman Primates**: Conducting this research in rhesus macaques adds a significant translational aspect, as the findings can be more readily applied to understand human brain processes in a clinical context. This use of animal models in the realm of hallucinogen research, particularly with both substances being administered within the same subjects, is not commonly seen in existing literature.\n\n### Conclusion\nOverall, the paper represents a valuable contribution to the field of psychopharmacology by providing novel insights into the functional connectivity effects of hallucinogens that have not been previously compared in such a direct manner. The combination of comparing two different classes of hallucinogens, elucidating the significance of the claustrum in altered states of consciousness, and employing a nonhuman primate model reinforces the study's originality and potential impact on future research in the field."

                "review": "### Ethical Concerns Review\n\n#### 1. Use of Non-Human Primates\nThe study involves three male rhesus macaques, and ethical considerations related to the treatment and welfare of these animals are paramount. It is essential to detail how the animals were cared for, which seems be considered, given that they were under constant supervision and monitored for physiological parameters. However, it is imperative for the researchers to thoroughly justify the necessity of using non-human primates over alternative models, particularly in terms of the potential suffering and stress caused to the animals. A more transparent discussion regarding the specific benefits derived from using this model compared to human trials or other types of studies would strengthen the ethical foundation of this research.\n\n#### 2. Informed Consent and Autonomy\nIn studies involving human participants, informed consent is crucial. For non-human subjects, direct consent is not possible, but the principles of respect and ethical treatment must still apply. Clarifying how the study complied with ethical standards for animal research, including adherence to the guidelines and regulations set forth by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), could enhance the manuscript\u2019s ethical rigor.\n\n#### 3. Anesthesia and Potential Pain\nThe use of anesthetics (xylazine and ketamine) and isoflurane for imaging raises ethical concerns about pain and sedation. While the authors state that physiological parameters were maintained within normal ranges, any potential pain, discomfort, or adverse reactions to these substances should be thoroughly addressed. Discussion of how the use of anesthetics could interfere with the study's goals and the measures taken to minimize any harmful effects is warranted.\n\n#### 4. Psychological Impact of Hallucinogens\nInvestigating the effects of hallucinogens such as psilocybin and salvinorin-A\u2014especially concerning their potential for inducing psychological distress or adverse reactions\u2014introduces ethical considerations about the psychological well-being of the subjects. The study should explicitly assess how these substances are expected to affect the welfare of the animals during and after the administration period. Furthermore, reactions induced by such substances could potentially lead to longer-term effects that require monitoring.\n\n#### 5. Scientific Justification and Harm-Benefit Analysis\nThe ethical justification of using hallucinogens in research is largely dictated by the anticipated benefits that may arise from the findings. The authors should provide a comprehensive analysis of the potential benefits of this research to contribute significantly to medical science, especially concerning psychiatric disorders. A robust harm-benefit analysis should be integral to justifying the ethical implications of administering these substances to animals.\n\n#### 6. Reporting and Transparency\nTransparency in how the drugs were administered, the monitoring procedures in place, and any adverse effects observed will bolster the ethical integrity of the study. Ensuring that all data, including negative outcomes or unintended consequences, are reported is vital for accountability and the advancement of ethical standards in animal research.\n\n### Conclusion\nUltimately, while the paper makes significant strides toward understanding the effects of hallucinogens on functional connectivity, addressing the ethical concerns surrounding the use of non-human primates, the administration of anesthetics, and the psychological impact of hallucinogens is crucial. A comprehensive discussion of these matters, including justification, monitoring, and transparency, will not only enhance the ethical rigor of this research but also contribute positively to the discourse on animal research ethics in the scientific community."

Here are some comments regarding the methodology:\n\n1. **Animal Model Selection**: The use of nonhuman primates provides valuable translational insights given their closer neuroanatomical and physiological similarities to humans compared to rodent models. However, the sample size is limited (NHPs = 3). This raises concerns regarding the generalizability of the findings. Future studies might benefit from a larger sample size to validate the results.\n\n2. **Drug Administration**: The injection dosages for Psilocybin and Salvinorin-A varied significantly, which could have confounded the effects observed. This variability in dosage not only affects pharmacodynamics but also introduces difficulty in directly comparing the two substances. It would be crucial to ensure that dose-response relationships are addressed in the analysis or balanced to mitigate confounding factors.\n\n3. **Conditioning Controls**: Although the authors note the variable resting times between drug administrations, they should elaborate on the steps taken to control for potential carryover effects from one drug to the next. Ensuring that all physiological conditions are stable prior to injections could further solidify the findings.\n\n4. **Anesthesia Protocol**: The use of isoflurane and premedication with xylazine and ketamine is appropriate for maintaining stable physiological conditions; however, the authors noted a need for ventilation during Salvinorin-A administration. It is essential that this potential confound be adequately addressed in the analysis, as changes in functional connectivity could stem from differences in anesthetic effects rather than the pharmacological action of the hallucinogens themselves.\n\n5. **fMRI Data Processing**: The preprocessing steps of the fMRI data appear comprehensive. However, more information on the specific parameters used for motion correction and the rationale behind the smoothing kernel would enhance clarity. Additionally, discussing the methodology for selecting seed regions could provide useful insights into the analysis strategy, especially in a context where regions are closely connected or implicated in overlapping functions.\n\n6. **Statistical Analysis**: The paired t-tests employed for pre- and post-drug comparisons are appropriate. However, further elaboration on the correction for multiple comparisons is warranted to assure the independence of the results. It would also be beneficial to include more robust statistical approaches such as mixed-effects models that can account for intra-animal variability.\n\n7. **Limitations Discussed**: The authors did well to acknowledge limitations, such as autonomic contributions and the potential confounding effects of ventilation on functional signals. Including explicit strategies that were or could be employed to mitigate these confounders would strengthen the methodological rigor of the study. The rationale for not using drug dosages as covariates is a point that requires clarification for the reader's understanding.\n\nIn conclusion, the methodology provides a solid framework for examining the effects of hallucinogens on brain connectivity, but enhancements regarding sample size, control measures, dose comparisons, and further clarity in analysis steps would improve reliability and reproducibility. Addressing these areas may better support the overall findings and interpretations presented in the paper."

The novelty of the study is multifaceted and includes key aspects:\n\n1. **Comparison of Drug Classes:** The study uniquely compares the acute effects of psilocybin (a serotonergic hallucinogen) and salvinorin-A (a non-serotonergic hallucinogen) on functional connectivity. This within-subject design is particularly innovative, as previous studies have largely focused on one substance at a time. This comparative approach allows for insights into how different mechanisms may affect similar brain networks, enhancing our understanding of hallucinogenic effects. \n\n2. **Focus on Multi-region Connectivity:** By investigating multiple brain regions implicated in hallucinogenic effects (such as the claustrum, prefrontal cortex, and default mode network), the authors provide a more comprehensive view of the interconnectedness of these areas, which has been under-explored in previous literature. This focus on specific neural circuits (e.g., the cortico-claustro-cortico network) highlights the complexity of hallucinogenic actions and emphasizes the relevance of these circuits in cognitive functions and potentially in psychiatric conditions.\n\n3. **Implications for Understanding Hallucinogenic Mechanisms:** The paper proposes that the identified circuitry could inform future research into hallucinogens as therapeutic agents for cognitive disorders characterized by hallucinations. This is highly relevant given the ongoing renaissance in psychedelic research and the potential implications for clinical applications.\n\n4. **Integration with Existing Models:** The authors' findings extend existing frameworks (like the CCC model) by incorporating new data on functional connectivity changes induced by both drugs. This integration helps construct a more nuanced model of how hallucinogens produce altered states of consciousness and highlights the need for further research into the modulation of cognitive networks.\n\n5. **Methodological Rigor:** The rigorous use of fMRI and the detailed analysis of functional connectivity contributes to the novelty of the study. Using a nonhuman primate model enables greater translational validity for human studies, thereby addressing a pertinent gap in the psychopharmacological literature.\n\nIn summary, the paper exhibits significant novelty in scientifically dissecting the differential and overlapping effects of two distinct classes of hallucinogens on brain connectivity. This work not only adds valuable data to the field but also sets a foundation for future research on the therapeutic potential of hallucinogens in treating psychiatric disorders. The authors successfully address an important gap in the current understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of hallucinogenic effects."

The integration of findings provides a comprehensive view of hallucinogenic actions, enhancing our understanding of their neurobiological mechanisms.",
            "weaknesses": "1. The small sample size (only three male rhesus macaques) significantly limits the generalizability of the findings and reduces statistical power. 2. The differing dosing regimens of psilocybin and salvinorin-A were not adequately controlled for pharmacokinetics, which could confound results. 3. The potential impacts of anesthesia on functional connectivity were not thoroughly addressed, raising concerns about the validity of resting state measurements. 4. Variability in resting periods between scans could have influenced results, and this should have been more rigorously controlled. 5. The paper lacks a thorough exploration of potential long-term effects of hallucinogens on NHPs, which is vital for ethical considerations.",
            "comments": "The study makes a commendable effort to delineate changes in connectivity between the two hallucinogens, but it does require more comprehensive ethical considerations regarding animal welfare and long-term effects. The authors should explore alternative methodologies or models and discuss these in light of their findings to strengthen the ethical grounding of the research.",
            "rating": "good",
            "confidence": "confident",
            "ethical_concerns": "1. Ethical concerns regarding animal welfare need to be addressed more transparently, particularly focusing on monitoring stress and wellbeing during drug administration. 2. The use of controlled substances like psilocybin and salvinorin-A mandates clear compliance with legal regulations which should be explicitly stated. 3. Potential long-term psychological impacts on NHPs should be discussed, emphasizing how effects will be monitored post-recovery to ensure animal safety. 4. The justification for using NHPs rather than alternative models should be explicitly outlined, considering the absence of informed consent from these animals. 5. Transparency in obtaining ethical approvals and justifying the research's societal benefits is crucial, particularly given the sensitive nature of involving sentient beings in research involving controlled substances."
