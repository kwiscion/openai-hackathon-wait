    "rationale": "The manuscript presents significant insights into the effects of psilocybin and salvinorin-A on brain functional connectivity using a robust within-subject design with nonhuman primates. However, the primary concerns noted include the limited sample size, which affects generalizability, and the variable dosing of the drugs, which may introduce confounds. Additionally, a more thorough examination of the ethical implications related to animal welfare is required. The clarity of how connectivity changes translate into cognitive outcomes also needs further elaboration. The findings are intriguing and pave the way for future research, but substantial changes are necessary before a publication recommendation can be confidently made.",
    "key_strengths": "The study effectively utilizes sophisticated methodologies, including fMRI and seed-based connectivity analysis, providing a detailed understanding of hallucinogenic effects. It highlights significant alterations in connectivity within brain networks, contributing important knowledge to the field of psychopharmacology.",
    "key_weaknesses": "The study's limited sample size of three male rhesus macaques raises concerns about the generalizability of its findings. There is also variability in drug dosages without covariate control, which could confound results. Furthermore, a lack of depth regarding cognitive implications and ethical considerations regarding animal welfare detracts from the manuscript's overall robustness.",
    "specific_revisions": "1. Address the limited sample size and discuss its implications on the findings. 2. Provide a deeper analysis of the variable dosing effects and potential confounds. 3. Enhance the exploration of cognitive alterations and subjective experiences linked to drug administration. 4. Include a more comprehensive discourse on ethical considerations regarding the use of nonhuman primates in the study.",
