    "decision": "minor revisions",
    "rationale": "The paper presents FastGen, a novel adaptive KV cache compression method that significantly reduces memory usage during generative inference for large language models (LLMs) without impacting generation quality. It shows substantial empirical results demonstrating GPU memory reductions while maintaining performance. However, the paper requires revisions for a more thorough discussion of its limitations, a stronger comparative analysis with existing techniques, and improved clarity regarding theoretical frameworks and scalability concerns. Addressing these points will enhance the paper\u2019s overall impact and contribution to the field.",
    "key_strengths": "1. **Innovation**: Introduces FastGen, which effectively reduces memory footprint with negligible quality loss. 2. **Empirical Evidence**: Strong empirical results demonstrate effectiveness across multiple benchmarks. 3. **Clarity**: Logical flow and structure of the paper are commendably clear, making it accessible to practitioners.",
    "key_weaknesses": "1. **Limitations**: Lacks a thorough discussion on limitations, particularly scenarios where FastGen may underperform. 2. **Comparative Analysis**: Insufficient comparative analysis with existing methods concerning computational overhead and performance under diverse workloads. 3. **Theoretical Context**: Needs a more detailed exploration of theoretical frameworks to clarify applicability.",
    "specific_revisions": "1. Expand the discussion on limitations of FastGen in varying contexts. 2. Include a comparative analysis of FastGen vs. existing methods regarding computational overhead and performance metrics. 3. Enhance theoretical framework explanation to provide clearer context for the proposed method\u2019s applicability.",
